# Installation Fixes & Improvements Summary

## What Was Fixed

### ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: Missing `scipy` dependency**

**Problem:** 
- The Reddit visualization script (`scripts/reddit/visualization.py`) imports `scipy` for interpolation and smoothing:
  ```python
  from scipy.interpolate import make_interp_spline
  from scipy.ndimage import gaussian_filter1d
  ```
- This dependency was **NOT** in the original `requirements.txt`
- Would cause `ImportError` when running visualizations

**Fix:**
- ✅ Added `scipy>=1.10.0,<2.0.0` to requirements.txt
