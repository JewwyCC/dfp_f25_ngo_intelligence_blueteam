# Lessons Learned - Master Scraper Integration

## 🔍 Problems Encountered & Solutions

### 1. **Google Trends API Rate Limiting**
**Problem:** Google Trends script was getting stuck making API calls, causing 20+ minute timeouts.

**Root Cause:** 
- API rate limiting by Google
- No caching mechanism
- Script was being called fresh every time

**Solution:**
```python
# Added 7-day caching check in master_scraper.py
if recent_viz_exists:
    # Reuse existing data instead of making new API calls
    output_files = self.copy_google_trends_outputs()
```

**Lesson:** Always implement caching for external API calls with rate limits.

---

### 2. **File Cleanup Preventing Reuse**
**Problem:** Master scraper was deleting viz files after copying them, preventing reuse.

**Root Cause:**
```python
# Old code that deleted viz files
if viz_dir.exists():
    for f in viz_files:
        f.unlink()  # This prevented reuse!
```

**Solution:**
```python
# Keep viz files for reuse to avoid API rate limits
# NOTE: We keep viz files in viz/google_trends for reuse
```

**Lesson:** Consider file retention policies carefully - some outputs are expensive to regenerate.

### 3. **Missing Dependencies**
**Problem:** Multiple missing packages caused module failures:
- `newsapi` → News API failed
- `praw` → Reddit failed  
- `wordcloud` → News visualizations failed
- `geopandas`, `folium`, `statsmodels` → Google Trends failed
- `transformers`, `torch` → Political classification failed

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install newsapi-python praw prawcore wordcloud
pip install geopandas folium us statsmodels
pip install transformers torch textblob
```

**Lesson:** Verify ALL module dependencies are in `requirements.txt` and installed.

---

### 4. **Output Directory Structure**
**Problem:** Each module was outputting to different locations:
- Google Trends → `scripts/google_trends/` + `viz/google_trends/`
- News API → `scripts/news_api/`
- Reddit → Various locations
- Bluesky → `data/bluesky/sessions/`

**Solution:**
- Master scraper consolidates ALL outputs into `master_output/session_*/`
- Copies from various source directories
- Creates unified session directory with timestamp

**Lesson:** Centralized output directory makes it easy to find all data from one run.

---

### 5. **Google Trends Visualization Completeness**
**Problem:** Earlier runs only generated 8/13 visualizations (missing seasonal plots for 2 themes).

**Root Cause:**
- Script was being interrupted or timing out
- Not enough time for comprehensive analysis
- Some themes had insufficient data

**Solution:**
- Allow Google Trends to run without timeout
- Use cached data when available
- Generated 20 visualizations in final run (even more than reference!)

**Lesson:** Complex analysis modules need sufficient runtime and graceful degradation.

## ✅ Best Practices Established

1. **Caching Strategy:**
   - Cache expensive API calls for 7 days
   - Check for recent data before making new requests
   - Balance freshness vs. API limits

2. **Dependency Management:**
   - Document ALL dependencies in `requirements.txt`
   - Include version numbers for stability
   - Test imports before running scrapers

3. **Output Consolidation:**
   - Single `master_output/session_*/` directory per run
   - Timestamp-based session naming
   - Copy (don't move) files to preserve originals

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Graceful degradation when modules fail
   - Continue with other modules even if one fails
   - Comprehensive logging in `master_log_*.json`

5. **Time Management:**
   - Allocate time budgets per module
   - Allow critical modules (Google Trends) to exceed budget
   - Fast modules (Bluesky) can complete under budget
