1nx6vyu,homeless,There really needs the be a building for all in one services for homeless,"Everywhere I look one service is a bus ride across town and the other is in another city like damn! 


There needs to be a facility for homeless to stay over night, offers showers, food bank , job search Library section, ordering missing IDs and documents needed to get a job and even people who are old and homeless to get permanent residents for obvious reasons. 

But this stuff would cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars. This is the stuff I want my tax dollars to go to even tho it goes to food stamps and medical insurance.


I will mention that I'm not homeless but when I was super poor and close to becoming it. I relied heavily on these services and luckily down town was walkable.but I've come across a lot of people are or were and accessing these services is extremely hard when the town depends on driving alone just to one building then the other! It's so frustrating.

All I can do is donate to these services in my city that help the homeless to local charities. 


I hope you guys all stay safe out there.",13,0.88,24,2025-10-03 14:19:31,sirpentious,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/1nx6vyu/there_really_needs_the_be_a_building_for_all_in/,True,hot,5.334200525555556,1.8461538461538463,2.4371037304875323,-0.01625816993464053,0.38513071895424844,1102,205
1nxejod,homeless,"Ok, I'm homeless, ill, alone in with debts in 23 yo, need advice and motivation to fight","
So about myself, I am 23 years old, I live in Ukraine and I am in incredibly difficult situation. I am homeless like 1month (for the last few days I have been living with a friend), I have problems with my spleen, I am in debt due to scams, my naivety and passivity, and I am experiencing a difficult mental state due to the loss of my brother in the war, and quarrels with my parents because of my situation. 

You ask, how did you get into this?  I was a student and naive, a year and a half ago unknown people started blackmailing me with my data and documents (I didn't know who they were and where they got me from), and demanded about $200 from me (for Ukraine, that's a lot of money). At that time, I was unemployed, so I decided to take a microloan, which I thought I would pay off over time if I found a job, but time went by, the job didn't disappear, and I repaid the previous loan with the next one and so on for six months, at a certain point I managed to find a job, but it was too late... The amount was already too large, but in small steps, month after month, minimally, and there were steps, but the death of my brother in the war hit me and my family, I couldn't focus on the debts and problems started, my parents supported me at first, but under pressure from the debt collectors they stopped talking to me... All this time I lived in a dormitory near the university, so at least I didn't think about housing, but since the end of August I was evicted, for some time I lived on the street, but  Now I was able to move in with a friend for a while, but it won't be forever.... Also in August my side hurt, often sharp pains or just a feeling like something was bothering me, so in September, after moving in with a friend for a while, I went to the hospital and.... I have an enlarged spleen, I didn't have money for medicine for a long time, so my condition got worse... I'm afraid of what the next check-up will say, and I won't go there, it's difficult, I also have almost no money for food. The only plus is that I have a job, but almost all of my salary goes to paying off debts, like this...

It is very difficult to somehow move on, I just can't find a way and just motivate myself. If you can help with advice or anything, I will be incredibly grateful for it!

1nw3ahh,homeless,A talk about addresses,"We get a lot of people saying they can't do anything because of addresses. However, this is NOT the deal breaker people think it is.

This is mostly for the curious and younger folks. Old hats, this is basic. And some will disagree or have things to add. That's okay.

Most of the time, **all addresses are used for is to fill out something in a database.**

It's for paperwork completion. Usually employment applications, cell phone service, things like that.

You can use your old address of of an ID or you can make one up. Only thing is some databases are finicky. Especially when dealing with things like opening bank accounts or prepaid accounts. But as long as you use a real address, most will not check. And if they want to mail stuff to you (statements, end of year tax info), there's usually a way to set this up to email instead. Or by the time that comes and in a more secure situation, set up mail change of address.

But what if they have to mail you something you actually need?

The most common things are plastic cards (benefit, pay cards, IDs in a few states, replacement debit/credit), social security cards, some legal documents (but more are going online), and people that still mail checks in 2025 of all things.

With that, most shelters you can make an arrangement to accept this mail a long as you don't start drama. Many will do this if you talk to them or at least knows who does. Some cities even have drop in centers for this. But you may be limited as to only be able to check at certain times or days.

There's also PO Boxes. Problem is they want an address. There are ways around this like general delivery, But I found the postal workers not sympathetic to my plight and refused to give me one. I

Private mail boxes, they don't care. But are much more expensive. May be worth it if you need lots of important stuff mailed and privacy if you have the cash.

One special case is plasma donation. Almost all the plasma centers in the US want someone dwelling in a certain area. You must either have a lease or ID in that area or something with your name on a piece of mail. And they trick you to root out homeless. They make you recite the address. But if you have that, you have income. Just be mindful of appearance/ smell as they don't want to chase off donors. They can and will defer people for that. also drink lots of water because this does mess you up if you don't and don't drink a lot when doing this.

1naaj1x,homeless,accidentally got 4 big Cinnabons instead of 4 minis and now I feel guilty,"Since I have been homeless for a while now, I can usually tell when someone else is too, even if they do not look it in the stereotypical way. Today I was looking for free food apps and saw that Cinnabon gives you 4 minibons with your first order. I figured out I could just buy a sauce for $0.99 to redeem it, so my total came to $1.30. When I went to pick it up, they handed me a big bag. I repeated my name, and they said, ""yes, this is your order."" I checked the receipt and it was definitely mine, but when I opened the bag, instead of 4 tiny rolls, it was 4 of the big classic ones. At first I wanted to go back and tell them, but since the sauce I ordered was in there too, I knew it was not someone else‚Äôs order, just a mix-up. I felt guilty but decided to keep it. The pack was not heated, so I went to the other Cinnabon in the mall (for some reason there were two) and asked if they could warm them up and put them in separate boxes. The employee was really kind and did it for me.

I ate one and gave the other three to people sitting in the food court who I could tell were also homeless. They did not really look it, but I could tell, and they were thankful. Still, I felt guilty afterward because I know how much some of us try to hide our situation, and by giving them food I felt like I was exposing it. Even though they appreciated it, I could not shake that feeling. I am still not sure if I did the right thing especially since it was only dessert and not a real meal.

1niwiux,homeless,I noticed a stranger accidentally drop his money so I picked it up and went to give it to him and he threatened to call the police on me.,"I was walking by the park and there was a guy who was walking in front of me while talking on his phone. He took out something from his pocket and accidentaly dropped something that looked like money. Upon closer inspection, I saw that it was a $100 bill so I picked it up. The guy hadn't even noticed it that he dropped his money, he was still talking on his phone and kept walking unaware. I won't lie and say I wasn't tempted to just pocket it and walk away because it would have made a world of a difference to someone like me. 

No one else had noticed so I easily could have gotten away with it, but I just didn't have it in me. I ran up to him to give it to him. I held out the money and explained that I saw it fall out of his pocket. He checked his pockets then snatched it from my hand and he threatened to call the cops on me because according to him, the fact that I had his money means I must have pick pocketed him. I just said you are welcome and walked away. Why would I steal money then return it? I don't know if he was hostile because of how I look.

I've lost a lot of weight since I became homeless so my clothes don't fit that well and because I don't sleep well, my face looks it. I do try my best to look clean and presentable though because I am lucky enough to have found a part time job that I just can't afford to lose. I don't even know why I am trying to rationalize his behavior, deep down I know that it doesn't even matter how I looked to him, a normal person wouldn't have acted the way he did. The whole experience just left me feeling deflated.

1nmp48b,homeless,The 10 Commandments of Homelessness,"Here are the 10 Commandments of Homelessness ‚Äî the most critical truths and survival strategies to hold onto when you first find yourself unhoused. This is about staying alive, staying human, and staying smart.

The 10 Commandments of Homelessness

1. Ditch Your Pride ‚Äî Keep Your Dignity

Pride will get you hurt, ignored, or passed over for help. You don‚Äôt have time for shame. But don‚Äôt confuse that with giving up your self-respect. Always carry yourself with dignity, even if you haven‚Äôt showered in three days. You‚Äôre still you ‚Äî no matter where you sleep.

2. Make Safety Your First Religion

Your number one job is to stay safe. Not warm. Not comfortable. Not well-fed. Safe. Scope out every spot before you settle in. Trust your gut. Don‚Äôt let exhaustion trick you into taking dumb risks. Where you sleep, who you trust, what you carry ‚Äî it all matters.

3. Protect Your ID Like It‚Äôs Gold

Your ID is the key to everything: food, shelter, a job, benefits, and eventually getting out. Memorize the number. Make copies if you can. Put it in a Ziploc and keep it close ‚Äî even when you sleep. Replace it immediately if it's lost.

4. Learn to Travel Light, Pack Smart

Every ounce counts. Everything you carry should serve a purpose ‚Äî shelter, warmth, food, water, hygiene, documentation, tools. No dead weight. No ‚Äújust in case‚Äù items. If it doesn‚Äôt serve your survival, ditch it.

5. Stay Clean ‚Äî As Clean as You Can

Hygiene is more than comfort. It‚Äôs mental clarity, self-worth, and public perception. Clean socks prevent infection. Baby wipes buy you dignity. A clean look can mean the difference between getting help or being dismissed. Shower when and where you can.

6. Trust Cautiously ‚Äî But Find Allies

Not everyone on the street is dangerous, but not everyone is safe either. The rules of trust are different now. Test people before you believe them. But once you find someone who has your back? Keep them close. A good ally can save your life.

7. Eat Every Chance You Get

Don‚Äôt turn down food. Don‚Äôt assume you‚Äôll find some later. Hunger clouds your thinking, weakens your body, and steals your spirit. Whether it‚Äôs a food pantry, a stranger‚Äôs kindness, or a church plate ‚Äî take it. Store it. Share it if you can.

8. Stay Invisible When You Need To Be

The less you‚Äôre seen, the less you‚Äôre targeted. Blend in when you must. Move with intention. Don‚Äôt loiter where you sleep. Don‚Äôt make enemies where you eat. Watch the quiet ones ‚Äî they‚Äôve usually been out here the longest for a reason.

9. Learn the System, Then Use It

Get familiar with local shelters, food banks, hygiene stations, and churches. Know who does what and what time. Learn what documents you need for housing apps or job help. Take free classes. Use public libraries. Use everything. You're not a burden ‚Äî you're a human being trying to survive a rigged system.

10. Don‚Äôt Let the Street Rewrite You

You may live outside, but you are not less than. You are not garbage. You are not disposable. This system wants you to believe you‚Äôre the problem ‚Äî you‚Äôre not. Keep your heart, your humor, your humanity. This world is broken, not you.

1nhfjh2,homeless,Came across paths with an individual intent on doing harm.,"So I have been homeless for 2 weeks. I was sitting at a park bench at night. 2 younger kids on bikes were asking me questions. I was naive, they said they found an axe, they were wondering how to sharpen it. 

I was like here like this, on the ground.

They asked me if I'm homeless. I say no.

They walk over to the opposite side of the benched area. One starts scrapping the axe on the ground. The other...

""He seems like a nice guy, don't do it""

I pick up my phone and pretend to call friends to hang out at that location. The 2 kids bolt. 

This is the suburbs of Chicago. 

Stay safe

1nlorda,homeless,My friend from another state who offered to let me crash left me stranded on the streets of his city,"Basically title. So I've been struggling with homelessness for a few weeks now, and an old friend I told about it from school volunteered to take me in for a while. Guy brought me a bus ticket to his city a state away then picked me up at the station.

Now as it turns out, he didn't actually have a plan as to where to put me to crash, nor did he tell his wife until the last minute that he wanted to take me in. Before I touched down, they apparently got into a huge argument about it, as well as the fact that he never told her that he purchased the bus ticket until she found out after checking their bank record.

Reasonably, she isn't ""yet"" adjusted to the idea of someone she doesn't know staying in the house. She's also the one responsible for cleaning and she isn't thrilled about the idea of cleaning up after a stranger. Needless to say, that fell through, though he promised that she'd come around in the next day or two. 

He tried taking me to his sister and brother-in-law's house, and they obviously said no. After that, he tried taking me to the men's shelter but they were full for the night, and also couldn't squeeze me in anyway since my ID is out-of-state, and by extension out-of-county.

I just asked him to take me back to the bus station since I'm already familiar with the area (on account of waiting there for 7 hours for him to pick me up) and can use the excuse that I'm waiting for them to open and for my bus to arrive if cops come to check on me.

Now I'm stuck in a random ass city a state over, on the streets, instead of on the streets of the area I'm familiar with in my hometown (no pun intended), with no way to get to my other friend who wants to take me in and who lives by himself, or any clue of when I'll be welcome in his home, if ever.

I'm just so fucking tired of this shit, man. When does the nightmare end?

1nv0i7s,homeless,Something people should know about homelessness from a homeless person.,"I wish I could get on a soapbox and yell it like the town yodeler of Ye Olden days. But that ship has sailed. And social media algorithms are a bitch too so I'll just say it here because everywhere else it will be downvoted and argued with into oblivion. 


Most people don't realize they are 1 bad day away from having your whole life ruined. 1 bad day away from going to jail. 1 bad day from losing your job. As little as 4-6 weeks to be evicted. Most people live paycheck to paycheck and don't have much in savings to maintain their lifestyle. The more people make the more they spend. It's an addiction nobody knows they have until it's too late. Most ""Rich"" people aren't really rich enough to even qualify to really be rich. The working rich are 100% guaranteed in debt. They spend more because they feel they are worth it, need it, and deserve it. And have the means to do so, and to borrow a lot. And they do. 98% of people are closer to being dirt poor than being anywhere near rich. Homelessness is a stigma perpetuated by the media, as a dirty, drug addicted thing that could never happen to you, unless you're stupid and lazy. Why don't you just get a job. Oh our taxes are wasted on you scumbags. Well many are unemployed because of a bad day. And it snowballs from there. Therefore unemployable. And in a pool of applicants I think a young pleasent face is going to be chosen over someone that has seen or been through some shit. McDonald's slogan is ""Now Hiring Smiling Faces"" Which means not you! And this is what people say we should do. As it's at least I'm not working at McDonald's. Better do something with your life or you'll be working at McDonald's. You wouldn't want to work with a felon or a bum. So maybe we should just die? And they're finally just coming out and just saying it. Most of you guys know this stuff and found out through a lot of heartache and pain. But this is for the curious. And the soon to be. Good luck begging on the street. They'll think it's just for drugs and nobody has any cash or change and a dollar doesn't buy shit anymore Thanks. Most Charities just make money to pay the employees and the people at the tops salary to drive benzes wear rolex watches live in McMansions and to brag about all the good things that they do for the vulnerable.

1nbdn2p,homeless,"Drowned and Disregarded: Where Are The Bodies of the Homeless Lost in Texas‚Äôs 1,000-Year Flood?","The flood that ripped through Texas wasn‚Äôt just another ‚Äúhistoric weather event.‚Äù It was the kind of disaster you‚Äôd expect to read about in an old history book, not live through.

Many called it a 1,000-year flood, but labels like that don‚Äôt prepare you for the reality of what it looks like when an entire river rises up and claims everything in its way.

It started just north of Camp Mystic, a 99-year-old girls‚Äô summer camp tucked right against the riverbank. The camp was in full swing, with children laughing and parents trusting their daughters to the care of adults who had lived alongside that river for generations. These weren‚Äôt careless people‚Äîthey were river experts, seasoned in the ways of floods. And yet when the water came this time, even they were caught in its fury.

¬†From there, the flood barreled downstream, swallowing neighborhoods, parks, and businesses. Official reports now say 135 people died, many of them children. For days, power and water were gone. Streets were impassable. FEMA showed up. Volunteers poured in. Police, fire, EMS, churches, strangers‚Äîall mobilized. Free meals were handed out, and everywhere you looked there were stories of rescue and resilience. For a moment, I thought maybe humanity wasn‚Äôt entirely lost.¬†

I didn‚Äôt know anyone who died. I barely knew anyone who lost property. Still, I couldn‚Äôt shake the weight of it. What stuck with me most wasn‚Äôt even the destruction‚Äîit was watching volunteers and responders work with relentless determination to find every single missing person. Dead or alive, people would be brought home. Families needed closure. And they got it.

¬†At least, families who *existed* in the official story.

Because here‚Äôs the part I can‚Äôt stop thinking about‚Äîthe part no one is mentioning. And the longer the silence stretches, the louder my shame grows that I‚Äôm only whispering about it now.

Most of the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù victims were people¬†who were here¬†for a concert and fireworks show that never happened. Visitors. Tourists. Families who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Their names were recorded, their photos published and ribbon memorial erected. So sad. So devastating.

But just beyond that carefully groomed park was a very different community. A community that no one talked about, except those who weren‚Äôt too afraid to speak with or extend help to. Hidden in the woods just beyond the park were roughly 200 homeless people living¬†in an¬†encampment, the river being the best part of their existence.

They weren‚Äôt visitors. They weren‚Äôt strangers. They were part of this place, even if we all pretended otherwise. You didn‚Äôt see them much because they couldn‚Äôt afford to be seen. Some came out in ones or twos to get food or health care, but rarely all at once. They couldn‚Äôt reveal their location‚Äîit was too dangerous, too risky.

Homelessness has been criminalized to the point where existing in public is enough to make you a target. So they stayed tucked away, hidden in tents and makeshift shelters. The police knew they were there. Many of us knew. And we all let them live invisibly, because it was easier than confronting what it meant.

And when the water came, it didn‚Äôt bypass them out of pity. It came straight for them. Fast, violent, merciless.

And it wasn‚Äôt just them. Farther upstream, among the trees along the river, lived hundreds of undocumented Mexican immigrants. Families, workers, human beings. They were the first in the flood‚Äôs path. The water would have hit them before anyone else. I don‚Äôt believe for a second they were spared. But again, nothing. No acknowledgement. No names.

I keep asking myself: where are they now? Where are the names? Where are the Jane and John Does? The news told me every missing person was accounted for. But how can that be true? Did two hundred people just vanish into thin air? Were their bodies pulled from the river, tagged, and quietly buried without a word? Or worse, are we supposed to believe they all somehow survived, unseen, while the rest of the community was devastated?

The silence around this mystery is deafening. Not one headline. Not one press conference. Not one list. It‚Äôs as though their deaths would be too inconvenient for the story we‚Äôre telling about this flood‚Äîtoo messy, too uncomfortable, too damning.

So I sit with this shame and bewilderment, because I don‚Äôt understand how we can publicly mourn one group while erasing another. It feels deliberate. Like if we don‚Äôt say their names, they never existed, and if they never existed, we don‚Äôt have to reckon with the fact that they died on our watch. That our silence helped bury them.

I didn‚Äôt know any of those 135 people who died, and I don‚Äôt know the names of the ones who never made the list. But I can‚Äôt stop thinking about them. They mattered. Their lives had value. They deserved dignity in death. And every day we pretend otherwise, we prove just how selective our compassion really is.

The flood didn‚Äôt discriminate. But we did.

And as much as we want to believe this was only a natural disaster, the truth is harsher: ***it was also a moral one.***

¬†Update: Since my original post, clean-up crews have kept pulling out remains‚Äîhundreds of them. Not whole bodies, just fragments. I spoke with a contractor who admitted she‚Äôd heard ‚Äúwhisperings‚Äù about the homeless. Whisperings? That word alone makes me want to climb the highest hill in the Hill Country and scream it until my throat tears. But it would still fall on deaf ears.

The truth is homeless people are being killed everywhere. The elites put them where they are, blame them for their condition by calling it a moral failure, and then pat themselves on the back for ‚Äúsolving‚Äù the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù by quietly erasing them. Kerrville and Fredericksburg sit at the heart of this contradiction‚Äîsmall towns with the highest concentration of wealth per capita in Texas. Elitism doesn‚Äôt just live here, it thrives. My fear is that the only acknowledgment these homeless souls will ever get is the silence of a riverbed holding what‚Äôs left of them.",94,0.92,42,2025-09-07 23:52:39,inkdvoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/1nbdn2p/drowned_and_disregarded_where_are_the_bodies_of/,True,top,619.7820725602778,0.44680851063829785,0.15166621327346944,-0.025759038259038258,0.4882432432432431,6138,1038

To,
The Officer In-charge,
Directorate of Town & Country Planning (DTCP) / RERA Office,
Gurugram, Haryana

Subject: Complaint regarding delay in possession of flat ‚Äì Aashiyara Society, Sector 37C, Gurugram

Respected Sir/Madam,

I am writing this complaint on behalf of the allottees of Aashiyara Affordable Housing Project, Sector 37C, Gurugram. The builder had committed to hand over possession of the flats by January 2023, but till date only around 70% of the work has been completed.

This project is registered under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Affordable Housing Scheme), yet the beneficiaries are suffering badly due to the inaction and negligence of the builder. Despite repeated follow-ups, no concrete timeline has been provided for possession.

It is extremely disheartening that DTCP and RERA officials appear to be favouring the builder, while the common man continues to suffer. The buyers are under tremendous financial pressure as they are simultaneously paying EMIs on bank loans, house rent, and children‚Äôs school fees.

We therefore request you to kindly:

1. Take strict action against the builder for non-compliance with possession timelines.


2. Impose penalties as per RERA guidelines.


3. Ensure a clear and time-bound schedule for completion and possession.


4. Safeguard the interests of buyers under the Affordable Housing Scheme.



We hope that the administration will take our grievance seriously and provide us timely justice.

Yours sincerely,
Bikram singh

1nxas1r,housingcrisis,"Submitting research tomorrow that adresses an underused building material, NAAC.","TL:DR I did a R&D project that turned in some good results. We need to translate this into newbuild home prices somehow. 



My co-author and I are submitting research tomorrow to a humble interdisciplinary peer reviewed journal.

The research adresses the regulatory gray areas regarding monolithic pour reinforced non autoclaved aerated concrete (NAAC). It's also known as aircrete. [https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Aircrete](https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Aircrete) It's an excellent insulator and perfect for building a house (I lived in a cellular concrete house for 20 years and it's awesome.

NAAC is used for roadbeds in Canada and Alaska. It's strong and an excellent insulator too. I've penciled out a quonset home lined with 30cm of 600KG/M3 cellular concrete. Looks like it would cost about $50/ sq foot for the shell (foundation footers, floor, walls etc. You can use regular rebar with it and tie the NAAC into full strength concrete. You can get an engineer's stamp for it and there's a million different mix designs. It's great stuff just ignored for some weird reason.

Relatively light ""dead load"" (weight of the material) and microstructure (bubbles) translates into excellent earthquake performance. It has a 12 hour fire rating and there's a video (gone now) that showed tests of different structures with fires blazing around them and the cellular concrete structure never even hit 100F inside. Everything would have been OK except foe the exterior paint. 

There's more research detailing building methods and other regulatory issues/ benefits of this building material that has basically been ignored in the USA even though it's the best way to make a home (in my opinion). I built a cellular concrete home in Asia and it's awesome.

I designed a good low cost cellular concrete mixer as part of the work. The design will be open source and the $3,000 raw materials cost should highlight the exorbitant margins equipment producers charge for similar equipment ($50,000 and up). .

I'll be here to answer any questions. I'm not selling anything. All this work is designed so people can have access to more of this kind of information and hopefully legit IBC approved cheap aircrete homes themselves.

Custon home builders have chased me around this site and will probably follow me here too. It's hard to counter their lies as there's only one of me and they never seem to get bored lying about this tech (their income requires us to not have alrternatives to stick built homes).

1nwiet9,housingcrisis,Investment firms are inflating rents ‚Äî here‚Äôs how we can fight back locally,"
We keep hearing that ‚Äúthe market‚Äù sets rent, but here‚Äôs what‚Äôs really going on:

Big investment firms like Farmland Partners and private equity groups are buying up land and housing, sometimes reselling it for 5x regional averages.

Single-family zoning locks up 96% of residential land in California and keeps housing supply low nationwide.

Firms like Blackstone even buy entire blocks of identical single-family homes and rent them out like apartment complexes ‚Äî you pay rent but never own.

Meanwhile, America‚Äôs existing buildings are crumbling. The GAO says federal repair backlogs doubled from $171B to $370B in just 7 years, and new construction quality keeps slipping.


It‚Äôs manufactured scarcity ‚Üí artificial rent inflation.

The good news? There‚Äôs a way to fight back at the local level:
If enough of us rent out our own properties affordably (VRBO, Airbnb, Hipcamp ‚Äî depending on your area), we can increase density, give people real options, and take customers + money away from land monopolies. That‚Äôs how communities build their own property kingdoms instead of watching Wall Street carve them up.

I put together a video breaking all this down with sources. Check it out here: https://youtu.be/KkcUcYXktlc

1nplv8d,housingcrisis,Local Democracy is Dead and That's Why You Can't Buy a House - Deep Dive Analysis,"I just listened to this podcast episode that completely changed how I think about America's housing crisis. The host breaks down some seriously uncomfortable truths that mainstream media won't touch.

**Key revelations:**

* America has a 3-6 million housing unit shortage (not just a pricing problem)
* 600,000+ households spend over 70% of income on rent in LA alone
* The average voter can name maybe 3 out of 27+ local elected positions they vote for
* NIMBY homeowners team up with anti-capitalist politicians to block ALL new development
* Rich people and unions control local elections because nobody else pays attention

The guest is Nick Halaris, a Stanford Law grad who's managed $300+ million in real estate investments. He explains how this isn't just an economic issue - it's a complete breakdown of democracy at the local level where housing decisions actually get made.

What really hit me was the generational conflict angle. Boomers control all the assets, political seats, AND their pension obligations are literally starving schools/police of money needed for current operations. Meanwhile young people are getting priced out and turning to social media get-rich-quick schemes instead of building real wealth.

The solutions they discuss aren't your typical partisan talking points either - term limits with higher pay for Congress, mandatory national service, state-level intervention to override local NIMBY politics.

If you're frustrated with surface-level political coverage and want to understand WHY the system seems broken (spoiler: it actually is), this episode delivers the goods.

It all feels hopeless trying to pay anything down any more.","I feel so stupid. Worst pain I ever experienced in my life, I never, EVER go to the hospital out of fear of the cost. Now, even after all the discounts, financial hardship application, etc, I still owe 6 thousand dollars. They told me to either settle for a payment plan of 600 a month or expect it in collections after a while. 

The trick of ""just send them 10-20 a month"" doesn't work for them. They've sent things to collections regardless, according to the experiences of neighbors and family members that have done anything with that hospital. 

When doing the financial assistance and getting my pay stubs I realized federal was being taken out, but not state. I changed it now, and added an extra 10% to be taken out for my remaining paychecks to try making it up, but god, that's 9 months of work and over 18 thousand dollars that hasn't been taxed at state level I'm going to deal with at tax time. 

I've tried so, so fucking hard. I had less than 2 thousand left to pay off on my credit cards, and then only student loans would be left. 

I've done nothing but suffer for over a year, working 60-70 hours a week, eating absolute cheap garbage to push my grocery bill down to 100-150 a month, rationing my fucking antidepressants to save money on them, and for what? For a fucking kidney stone, caused by the cheap diet, to give me a bill that's practically a rent payment over the next year if I don't want my credit screwed over? 

I'm never going to a hospital ever again. I don't care if I break my legs or get hit by a damn car, I can't do this again. I'd rather die at home. I'm on the verge of suicidal over this. I should've never agreed to let my brother take me when he heard me screaming for hours on end. 

I don't know what to do. I don't know the point of even trying to pay down my debts past the minimums any more and suffering this much to ""improve"" my situation when its never going to improve.

1nx11ok,povertyfinance,I‚Äôve never been so scared in my life,"I‚Äôm 23, moved out for the first time and struggling worse than I ever have in my life. I missed my rent payment this month because I have absolutely no money to my name. Like I‚Äôve overdrafted my bank account, almost maxed out my credit card, shit I‚Äôve got an overdue bill on my cashapp card. I‚Äôm NOT asking for money, just looking to vent. I have no car and had been relying on my bike to get around, but last month I caught a flat and I haven‚Äôt been able to fix it. It‚Äôs an e-bike and I guess apparently it‚Äôs  not as simple as taking off the wheel and replacing the inner tube üôÉ. 

My friends and partners have been helping e when they can, buying me groceries and spotting rides, but they can obviously only do so much. There‚Äôs a food pantry near my apartment that has also helped with that, so i‚Äôm not starving at least. 

I‚Äôm in between jobs right now. I‚Äôm completing paid training for a job right now but I‚Äôm struggling to get through all the material. I can‚Äôt even get around anywhere easily. I‚Äôm no stranger to a city bus, it‚Äôs just not always an option to get where I need to go. I have been without a job for about a month and it‚Äôs catching up to me. I‚Äôm so overwhelmed. I need to fix my bike, I really want to take it to someone but that costs money that I don‚Äôt have. I can barely even focus on completing training for my new job because all I can think about is my current situation. At least with my bike working, I was doordashing to make some extra money. I can‚Äôt even do that. I owe everybody money so the moment I do get paid, all of it‚Äôs going towards the paying that stuff off. I feel like there‚Äôs no respite. I don‚Äôt even know how i‚Äôm gonna accomplish starting this job because I don‚Äôt have any way to get there right now. I just did the math, when I eventually do get paid for my training, I will have $34 left to my name after paying off the overdraft fees and my cashapp card. Mind you, I still owe rent this month.I‚Äôm so stuck. I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe. 

I called 211 at the end of last month and was told they only help when you‚Äôve already received an eviction notice.As stated above I already owe so much to so many people that I can‚Äôt take out another loan. My credit is shot anyway. I literally don‚Äôt know what to do.

1nx2wus,povertyfinance,"needed car repairs and dental work, wiped my emergency fund in three days","I‚Äôm just so frustrated right now and needed to complain to people who get it. For context I‚Äôm 24, if that matters. 

My stupid car has to drive 45 minutes each way every day to work through the most stupid construction, and a suspension component broke. The bolt or whatever broke off and needed to be torched out. Repair came in like 200 over the estimate, plus I need new tires (and I know the mechanic was being honest with me, my girl is wonderful and didn‚Äôt even charge me for the diagnostic). Total repair + normal upkeep was 1300, not including the tires, which I need before November since I live in an icy midwestern hellscape. 

Prior to this I FINALLY passed the waiting period on my dental insurance to get the deep clean I know I desperately need. No cavities! BUT, of course, my previous dentist who said I didn‚Äôt need my wisdom teeth out was wrong :) and I have a pocket infection under my wisdom tooth bc of something about how it grew in creating a gum flap issue that now has bacteria growing in it. So I need oral surgery to remove my wisdom teeth, which my insurance doesn‚Äôt cover. 700+ for my deep clean and whatever that quote comes out to.

I make decent money (60kish) in a low cost of living area. I don‚Äôt have a car payment. I babysit on weekends for extra cash. I do pay all my own insurance etc. My emergency fund was finally at 6k. I was feeling so proud of that.

And yeah, I have 15k of inheritance sitting in a high yield savings account, but that‚Äôs supposed to be for a house, or a car someday. Not for normal expenses. 

This shit is so unsustainable. My situation in terms of expenses is better than most people and I‚Äôm still not able to get ahead in any meaningful way. The amount my car cost to fix was a whole ass paycheck. I‚Äôm just so sick of this. 

And I‚Äôm tired of people my age acting shocked when I tell them I‚Äôve been paying all my own bills - from health insurance to my phone bill - since I was 20. Just because someone is still eligible to be on their parents insurance until 26 doesn‚Äôt mean they will KEEP their kid on the insurance. They look at me like I‚Äôm nuts for choosing to be broke when it wasn‚Äôt a choice. I‚Äôm just exhausted.

I just need to complain really quick because OMG 

So I‚Äôve been thinking about donating plasma for a WHILE to get some extra money, but I hesitated on going because I was afraid my health would disqualify me. 

I decided to bite the bullet today and go try to donate just to find out once and for all and YEP!!! My health issues disqualify me from donating plasma for LIFE üíÄüíÄ

1nwr59u,povertyfinance,just have to get something off my chest,"just discovered this page and see that it‚Äôs a space where people can rant. I(30) got laid off from my job a few weeks ago. It was unexpected and am still in shock, i‚Äôm a social worker and am a little stressed about finding a new job but not too stressed. I do case management and with the experience i have i‚Äôll find something within the next 6 months (it‚Äôs an emotionally brutal and low paying job- so nobody wants to do it). But my partner(29) has not been a been able to find a job since they graduated in 2024. Before I was paying for everything, it fucking sucked but it was paycheck to paycheck doable with a very very small amount of fun money for me each month ($100-ish). but here we are now, and i have unemployment coming that will be $2k a month which is just enough to cover our rent. My partner has started applying for other jobs like retail and customer service now that‚Äôs it‚Äôs extremely dire. But he‚Äôs not hearing back from grocery stores and other retail places. Today he‚Äôs decided that he‚Äôs going to use a plain resume (his professional one is a portfolio) that doesn‚Äôt even has his degree on it just his customer service work he did a few years ago. I just need him to bring in 2k a month and it would be like it was before. He‚Äôs trying so hard but he‚Äôs just not fucking hearing anything. and it‚Äôs crazy. he‚Äôs got a degree from a good school and has retail/hospitality service as well as freelance experience in his field. i‚Äôm fucking stressed out all the time i don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôre going to do.


EDIT: wow thank you so much everyone, it‚Äôs nice to just feel heard and your pointers are valuableü©∑ we got approved for food stamps that will start in two weeks for more money than we spent on groceries before which will be a huge relief and kind of fun to have a bigger budget. I‚Äôm hopefully his new ‚Äúbasic‚Äù resume will get him more hits than his professional portfolio had. He‚Äôs got a degree in graphic/web/ui design so it‚Äôs a very art heavy website that he designed himself, he‚Äôs gotten interviews over the last year but is never selected and it‚Äôs been devastating to watch him face rejection over and over- i wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle it!

1nwofr3,povertyfinance,How do I avoid being old and working retail?,"Some of the stories I'm seeing on this forum are absolutely terrifying. How on earth can I avoid the fate of being a 55 plus year old man working at retail or fast food? 

I want to make it clear there is nothing wrong with honest work. There is no shame in it. But if there's anyone brave enough to share, what exactly happened? 

I'm entering middle age right now, and so I'm just confused on how you go from my age to 60 and not have any exact idea of where the pivot could have been made. Pretend that I spent all of my 20s and heck even 30s doing nothing but playing Call of Duty and smoking weed. That is still 20 more years I could have until my 60th year of age to steer the ship, so to speak, in a different direction.

I just want to know how you guys didn't see it coming. For some, I understand completely if say you were like... Say, a stay at home mom who's husband left her. I also understand about the idea of, say, health issues cropping up and not being able to really expand past it for some reason such as disability.

1nxcg5v,povertyfinance,Some Money Saving Tips I've Learned Over The Years,"Going through a rough patch myself for the last few months so I'm glad to find this thread. I thought I would share some stuff I've learned over my 36 years on this lovely and sometimes frustrating planet in the hopes it might help some folks. 

First off, some cheap food tricks I've learned:  
  
1. A can of Chef Boyardee ravoli makes a fine meal. They go for $1.25 at my local grocery store Kroger and at my local Dollar Tree. Works great for me and keeps me from feeling particularly malnourished like other cheap options.  
  
2. Peanut butter and saltines can be lived on too, and they go a long way if rationed right.  
  
3. Look for food deals everywhere, ALWAYS. Wendy's had an amazing $1 breakfast sandwich deal a few months ago. They're now and normally $3.79 and are amazing. Downloading the app gets you a free 10 piece nugget with a purchase if you wait a few days after downloading the app. Their $2 chicken sandwich with two free side sauces is my current go-to for lunch/dinner. $5 Biggie Bag as my only meal a day sometimes if I can afford it.  
  
4. The more you eat, the more you are hungry. Might seem obvious, or maybe not, but this one has been huge for me. When you eat a full-size meal that most of us would consider a normal one, your stomach stretches and grows bigger and your metabolism increases. This means your appetite will go up and hunger pains will too. Do this three times a day and you will end up eating two to three times more food than you actually need to live on at bare minimum. I've gotten by and lived off two sausage biscuits a day from Wendy's before. Two for $3 deal saved my life there. Same deal for other fast food spots. If you eat smaller meals gradually you can save a lot of money in the long run. I was so broke I was starving, so I definitely appreciated every bite I could get from then on.  
  
5. The Dollar Tree and similar stores are your friend, but not always. It all depends on the items. I had to do a double take to realize Pop-Secret Popcorn (3 packs), full bags of chips/pretzels, small bags of Zapp's chips, hot sauces, soy sauce, rice, multi-pack ramens, and a lot of household item necessities can be had there for $1.25 each. Paper towels, toilet paper, aluminum foil, cleaning stuff is almost always cheaper there unless you're buying in bulk for a family. Most is $1.25 to $1.50. Also good deals on random house stuff like trash cans, brooms, mops, etc. All of these are more expensive elsewhere, usually twice or more the price, sometimes more. Don't buy everything there though, that's how they make their money. Mostly has an edge on my local grocery store for this stuff though, all things considered. Just start checking prices everywhere you go. Meijer and Remke are currently way more expensive for all of this. 

6. If you need Wifi, a good deal on coffee/drinks, and shelter from the elements, Panera has a sip club deal for unlimited coffee (or drink of choice) for $15 a month, intro rate was only $4 for the first month when I signed up. Deals like this are where it's at. Keep an eye out for them everywhere.

And now some job related points and advice:

1. Doordash pays out daily now with a $2 fee if you really need the cash and have a vehicle but I'll warn you, only do it short term. Your car and wallet will thank you later. It has been a lifesaver in my most desperate moments though. They are way better to work for overall now than when I first worked for them in 2018. But my old car can't do that long term. I learned the hard way before.

2. Well paying jobs are ALWAYS hard to come by, especially ones that don't make you absolutely miserable. Most will. The lower paying jobs I've had were actually easier overall, and less pressure, but I always had to leave sooner or later for greener pastures that didn't always work out well. That's just been my experience. All jobs are hard to come by really. Cherish what you can find and don't let the usual complainers and downers ruin it entirely for you. I miss working at Jimmy John's for $7.25 an hour because of the food and people I worked with. Obviously not sustainable in the long term though.   
  
3. Always keep looking on Indeed, Glassdoor, Google, etc to keep tabs on things. I just found out that dieticians make $150 an hour working remotely and can get certified in about 2 years with an online degree. Wouldn't have learned that without just searching Indeed without putting in any descriptors. In other words, always keep an eye out for jobs and opportunity. Try to talk to people everywhere about this and network. Best way to find jobs really.

Some quick phone advice:

1. Tracphone has the cheapest service that I've found. $20 a month for unlimited talk and text and they use Verizon's towers. Never had an issue with service myself. Phones are $40-$80, 3GB of extra data is $10, and you can buy a sim kit for $1-$5 if you already have an unlocked phone that takes a sim card. I'm always surprised to hear what some folks pay for phone service when all they use it for is talk or text. This is all you really need in that case. This can save you a lot of money over time.  

And finally some general advice+philosophy learned from experience:

1. Don't give up. Fight the good fight, enjoy the little things, and keep working through things. Read some Thich Nhat Hanh if you're really feeling down. 'Peace Is Every Step' and 'You Are Here' have helped me through the worst times of my life, and formal breathing meditation can actually turn your mind around well if you are truly at the end of your rope and have no other options. Highly recommended in that case. It's given me the mental space to keep going before and improved my mood dramatically in times where I was literally about to have a nervous breakdown. Saved my life really, and I'm very grateful for those writings.   
  
2. Hard work, tenacity, and persistence are the only things that will actually improve your life, so keep at it even when the going gets tough. Don't ever get too discouraged. Don't let others get you down and keep a good perspective in tough times. It goes a really long way to simply tune out others and societal judgments as well. Don't think you're above others, but definitely don't think you're ever below them. Keep a level head at all times. 

I hope this helps. My situation is better right now, and also worse now, than it has been at other times in my life, but I'm not going out without trying my hardest to improve things for myself and hopefully others. Thanks y'all. Keep on keepin' on.
