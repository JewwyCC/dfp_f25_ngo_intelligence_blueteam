      "text": "The Other Side Village is building tiny cottages in Salt Lake City as part of its program to help people who've been chronically homeless. The organization also runs businesses to create jobs for residents.Jennifer Ludden/NPRhide caption MURRAY, Utah — On a weekday morning, about two dozen formerly homeless men and women file into a small room at The Other Side Village near Salt Lake City. \"How have you felt since our last meeting?\" asks Melissa Hepworth, a fellow resident here who tells the group that she's felt \"challenged with a little bit of shame.\" The people in this meeting have all been chronically unhoused — typically living outside for eight to nine years with significant addiction or mental illness. They are among the hardest to help, and that's exactly who the Village has targeted since it opened two years ago. \"Once you've forgotten how to work, forgotten how to engage with other people, forgotten how to solve human problems, forgotten how to manage finances, it takes a lot of work to restore some of those abilities,\" says Joseph Grenny, a co-founder ofThe Other Side Village. Across the country, much-needed housing and treatment programs for the unhoused are in short supply. There's also heated debate over which should be a bigger priority, with President Trump calling forforced treatment. This ambitious project in Utah offers short-term housing, rehab and mental health treatment, along with a kind of training program. People start in a prep school that teaches life skills for those who may have lost them. They must get and stay sober and are also required to work. The Village runs businesses to help create jobs for that. After six to 12 months, fellow residents vote to decide when someone is ready to \"graduate.\" At that point, they can move on to their own place, in tiny cottages the Village is building for permanent housing. \"We believe that human beings change when they're in an environment that expects something of them,\" Grenny says. \"When we succeed in doing hard things, we start to feel good about ourselves.\" The conversation at morning meetings is meant to build community, because supporting each other is a big part of the therapy here. Resident Patricia Jean Martin says it feels like starting a new life with people she can \"actually trust, be honest with, be accountable with.\" Patricia Jean Martin on the terrace of her shared apartment at The Other Side Village. She says living there feels like starting a new life with people she can finally trust.Marisa Peñaloza/NPRhide caption But that process can also be intense. \"You do have to listen to the feedback, and just work on it and change your behaviors,\" she says. \"And if you don't, you will be kicked out.\" To help with that change, there are coaches who know exactly what people are going through. \"I was introduced to drugs by one of my mom's boyfriends, probably around nine or ten years old,\" says coach Jackie Tress. After that came a car wreck and prescription pain pills, and then things really spiraled. Eventually she lost her house and daughter, living for years on the street and in and out of jail. \"Every time I got arrested I would think, all right, this is it, I'm done. And I would be provided resources,\" she says. \"But as soon as I hit the street, I would go right back to what I knew.\" Coach Jackie Tress at the prep school common area. She stands next to the photo of herself when she first exited homelessness.Jennifer Ludden/NPRhide caption Things changed when she went through The Other Side program herself, and could not believe one of the directors had also been homeless and addicted. \"Because I only saw the woman that was in front of me,\" she says. \"She just had such purpose and grace and I'm like, OK, if she can do it, I can do it.\" To drive home this transformation, the common area of the prep school has photos of Jackie and other coaches when they first exited homelessness. She looks exhausted in her photo, with red marks on her face and deep bags below her eyes — nothing at all like now. The Other Side began a decade ago astraining to reintegratepeople with a long history of crime and other troubles. But Grenny and other co-founders saw a growing need for a separate program to specifically addresschronic homelessness. That's defined as when someone with a disability, including addiction or mental illness, has been without housing for at least a year straight, or repeatedly over several years. The number of chronically homeless people in the U.S. hit arecord high last yearof more than 150,000, mostly living outside. \"Trying to recover from substance abuse, and you're homeless and you're on the street or you're in a shelter, it's very tough,\" says Dennis Culhane, who researches homelessness at the University of Pennsylvania. Typical shelter-based programs may only house people at night, leaving them essentially still homeless during the day, he says. There's little structure, certainly no jobs, and dropout rates are high. Meanwhile there's very little residential rehab, and it's usually for people who have private insurance or can pay out of pocket. So the Utah program \"is not something usually available to people who are homeless. It's pretty unique in my mind,\" he says. For the lucky few who can get it, federally subsidized permanent supportive housing also offers treatment for addiction and mental illness. But it's optional — not mandatory — and Culhane says while that works for most, it's not for everyone. \"I did a study in supported housing in New York City,\" he says. \"And about 30% of the people wanted to be in a clean and sober environment. So I think we need every option possible.\" Still, Culhane says The Other Side Village model is expensive and may be hard to scale up, especially since the sober and work requirements bar federal funding. The program aims to eventually become self-sufficient through the businesses it runs. But to launch, it has raised money from donors and gotten several million dollars in state funding. It's also leasing a large patch of city-owned land for a dollar a year. In a wide open dirt field on that land in Salt Lake City, The Other Side Village CEO Preston Cochrane stands near rows of new tiny cottages. There are 60 completed so far, where the first graduates from the prep school moved in less than a year ago. The plan in the next few years is to double prep school enrollment and build hundreds more cottages. \"We have coaches that live on site as well, just like the prep school,\" he says. There's also a neighborhood council and regular resident meetings. \"It's a supportive community. For many of them it becomes their family.\" There's an income limit, but otherwise people can stay here as long as they want. A health clinic is also under construction that will include mental health services and dentistry, and there will be a grocery store. Both places will offer jobs for residents. Cochrane says that \"100% of the folks who live here maintain a sober lifestyle. They pay rent and they work.\" Jennifer Davis loves her tiny cottage home, and her job a short drive away at The Other Side Donuts. The store and the donuts are whimsical and full of color. \"People are like, 'Oh, wow,' and they gasp,\" she says. \"It's a bright spot.\" Resident Jennifer Davis is the wholesale logistics manager at The Other Side Donuts. \"It proves to myself that I can have a career again, I didn't ruin it all with my choices,\" she says.Jennifer Ludden/NPRhide caption Davis once had a professional career and owned a condo but says she spent years lost, without housing, family or friends. She's now the donut store's wholesale logistics manager and says she's grateful for the chance to start over. \"It proves to myself that I can have a career again. I didn't ruin it all with my choices,\" she says. \"I can do a great job. I can be a professional leader.\"",

      "text": "A pedestrian walks past a tent encampment in Portland, Ore., on Jan. 24, 2024. President Trump has promised to sweep homeless Americans out of cities in part by forcing many into \"long-term institutional settings.\" Experts on homelessness and civil liberties have voiced alarm at the proposal.Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption PORTLAND, Oregon —On a sunny late-summer afternoon, Logan Whalen stood outside his barbershop in downtown Portland. Two homeless people who were huddled in a doorway nearby were using illegal drugs. He said drug deals sometimes happen openly on his block. \"I'm tired of it. It's mostly a nuisance, but it can also get a little bit scary,\" he said. Portland is nothing like the \"war zone\" that President Trump has described in recent speeches whilecalling for a deployment of National Guard troopsin the city. It's a foodie town, with high-end shops, restaurants and boutiques. On this day, the business district was busy with locals and tourists. But after years of effort by local officials, on many streets there are still signs of homelessness, often complicated by severe addiction and mental illness.  Whalen described one recent encounter where a homeless person blew fentanyl smoke in his face. Logan Whalen runs a barbershop in downtown Portland, Oregon. He says \"compassion fatigue\" is growing over the city's homelessness problem. But he also voiced concern over Trump's promise of a national crackdown designed to remove people living on the streets. \"Where do they go? Where are they going to put them — in jail? They need to stop cutting mental health funding,\" Whalen told NPR.Brian Mann/NPRhide caption \"I'm gay, very much a liberal Democrat, but compassion fatigue is a big thing,\" he said. \"I don't want to walk on the street [to avoid homeless people]. I want to walk on the sidewalk.\" Trump's answer to growing frustration, and fear, over America's homelessness crisis includes a plan to expand use of a legal process known as civil commitment. He says that in more cases, judges should be able to force people to accept medical care for addiction and mental illness. \"Our once-great cities have become unlivable, unsanitary nightmares, surrendered to the homeless, the drug-addicted and the violent and dangerously deranged,\" Trump said in acampaign video posted in April 2023. \"For who those are severely mentally ill and deeply disturbed, we will bring them back to mental institutions, where they belong.\" Trump gives remarks to law enforcement officers at the U.S. Park Police's Anacostia Operations Facility in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 21. The Trump administration deployed federal officers and the National Guard to the District of Columbia in order to place the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department under federal control and assist in crime prevention in the nation's capital.Anna Moneymaker/Getty Imageshide caption In July,Trump signed an executive orderurging local and state governments to make this kind of forced medical care significantly more common. \"Shifting homeless individuals into long-term institutional settings for humane treatment through the appropriate use of civil commitment will restore public order,\" he said. As the United States' homelessness crisis has deepened, Trump isn't alone in believing this kind of intervention should be used more often. Most states already have some form of civil commitment law. The process is typically used only in rare cases, when individuals pose an immediate threat to themselves or others. Judges may force individuals to accept closely monitored outpatient care; in other cases, they may be institutionalized in hospitals or residential care facilities, usually for brief periods. California, New York and now Oregon are among states led by Democrats that have moved to expand use of forced medical care. Another blue state,Massachusetts, has one of the highest rates of involuntary commitmentsin the U.S. for people facing drug addiction. Oregon Democratic state Rep. Jason Kropf, who crafted his state's new law, says he embraced the idea after seeing families and communities struggle. \"How do you balance helping people in crisis who aren't able to help themselves with not abusing that ability to over-institutionalize people?\" Kropf said. Judy Thompson, a longtime advocate for mental illness services in Oregon, lobbied in favor of the new standards. She, too, came to believe that civil commitment should be used more often after her son's bipolar schizoaffective disorder spiraled out of control in 2019. The episode led to a dangerous car crash. Alton Aanderud, age 53, has lived with a diagnosis of bipolar schizoaffective disorder for decades. At times, his mother, Judy Thompson, age 73, has urged judges to use Oregon's civil commitment law to force her son into hospitalization for his mental illness. Both agree this kind of government intervention has been necessary at times, but they also say it should be used rarely. \"Civil commitment is very scary because you don't know what you're getting into,\" Aanderud told NPR.Brian Mann/NPRhide caption No one was killed, but Thompson said her son put people in grave danger and he ended up with a criminal record, before a judge finally agreed to send him to a mental hospital. \"We need some wiggle room [in the law so judges can act] before things collapse and end up in this horrific nightmare,\" Thompson said. Thompson's son, Alton Aanderud, said he agrees that civil commitment was an important intervention that forced him to accept the medical help he needed. But he also said being hospitalized, even for relatively short periods of time, is disruptive and disorienting. \"It's not just, throw them all in an institution,\" he said. \"When I got out of Oregon State Hospital, I had nothing when I came home — no place to live, one pair of pants, one shirt,\" he said. \"It's disheartening when you go, 'Geez, I'm back at square one again.'\" With his mother's help, Aanderud was able to rebuild his life and now lives independently in his own apartment. But he says many homeless people don't have that kind of support network. \"Civil commitment is very scary because you don't know what you're getting into. They treat you, you get somewhat stabilized — then you're out the door and left to manage yourself,\" he said. Many experts interviewed by NPR agree that civil commitment, even when expanded, should be used sparingly. Some voiced alarm at Trump's goal of using forced medical care to \"restore public order,\" especially if it leads to people being institutionalized for long periods. \"What we don't want is to simply look at these folks asThey're annoying. They're on the streets. Let's lock them up where nobody can ever see them again,\" said Dr. Kenneth Minkoff, a psychiatrist and nationally recognized expert on government-mandated health care. \"That's not OK.\" Many people who study addiction and mental illness said they believe most homeless Americans should be helped with less invasive programs, including affordable health care and housing subsidies. \"We are talking about using a sledgehammer, removing people's freedom in institutions, in facilities which don't even exist,\" said Morgan Godvin, a drug policy researcher who spent years on the streets of Portland addicted to heroin, before recovering. \"Why are we going to the most expensive thing, that is most concerning for people's civil liberties?\" Dozens of tent camps like this one were purged from Washington, D.C., during Trump's August crackdown in the city. Trump has said he wants the D.C. effort to serve as a model for other cities. Experts on homelessness say that in many cases, there's no place for people living on the streets to go.Brian Mann/NPRhide caption One unanswered question in Trump's call for a national effort to expand civil commitment and long-term institutionalization is who would pay for it? There aren't enough residential facilities or trained medical personnel to care for even a tiny fraction of the 270,000 Americans who,according to federal data, live on the streets. Republicans in Congress have actually cut roughly $900 billion from Medicaid, the government insurance program that pays for most addiction treatment and mental health care in the United States. Trump administration officials told NPR they believe taxpayer dollars have been wasted by Democrats on \"woke\" liberal responses to homelessness, including \"housing first\" subsidies and \"harm reduction\" addiction programs. Trump's executive order calls for diverting some of those funds. \"Honestly, we think we can solve this without more money,\" said a senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"Part of it's simply accountability. We want federal dollars used more efficiently.\" Kropf, the Oregon state representative who pushed for Oregon's expanded civil commitment law, disagrees. He points out that Oregon has already budgeted $65 million to pay for new residential facilities to help care for people who may be forced into the health care system under the state's new civil commitment guidelines. \"It's the question everybody should be asking,\" Kropf said. \"If we're going to change the standard, do we have the ability to execute on that standard and make sure people get the services they need?\" Minkoff, the expert on institutionalization, said homeless people with severe addiction and mental illness will be costly to treat. Many have complex medical needs and require support after they've been stabilized to prevent them from winding up back on the street. \"We need more resources as it is,\" he said. \"These are folks who often, even when they're better, they're extremely vulnerable. They need appropriately ongoing supportive housing. There simply are not enough of those [programs] with adequate resources.\" Thompson, the advocate and mother who lobbied for Oregon's expanded civil commitment standards, is also wary of Trump's executive order. She thinks Oregon's new law is well crafted and nuanced and includes limitations on the amount of time an individual can be hospitalized. But Thompson worries that many states will expand civil commitment and forced institutionalization in ways designed to sweep homeless people with addiction and mental illness out of sight. \"It's like, throw the garbage away — these people are worthless,\" she said. \"It can be used for good or bad. It can be used to help or to harm.\" Supporters and critics of expanding civil commitment say they agree the test will come in the details of how each state law is crafted. The White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they believe Trump's executive order will be implemented in ways that help more people escape homelessness while respecting their rights.",
