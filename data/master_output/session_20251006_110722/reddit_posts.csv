1mbjy4n,homeless,Trump Executive Order Discussion,"This is the place to talk about anything related to Trump’s Executive Order regarding homelessness. Any posts outside of this thread will be removed. I know that this is stressful and there is a lot of fear and confusion about how this will be implemented and what it will actually mean. Because of that it is really important to keep this a **fact based** discussion. Posting unsubstantiated assumptions and speculative rumors is not helpful and only causes more confusion. 

It’s fine to talk about your opinions and feelings, but they need to be clearly framed as *opinions* and *feelings.* Any misinformation or obvious outrage bait will be removed. It’s important to evaluate the trustworthiness of your sources. If it feels like an article is trying to make you feel scared or angry, it may not be the most reliable source. 

Most importantly please be civil to each other. You can disagree with someone *without* resorting to personal attacks or name calling. You can hate someone’s opinion but still be respectful towards the person as a human being. Stay on topic and play nice everyone.

1h783gu,homeless,Trying out new feature,"Hey y’all,

I’ve seen a few people talking about how there has been a lot of negativity on the sub lately. Maybe having a group chat will help us all get to know each other better and give us more empathy. Additionally with most of us dealing with cold, unpleasant weather for the next few months the group chat will give us a place to socialize and get some real-time human connection. 

So… at the top of the feed you should see a tab that says **chats.** You can click that and head in to General Homeless Chat to try it out. I plan on adding some fun events, games, or themes too, if you have an idea for something fun to do in the chat send me a message! 

Rules for the chat are basically the same as in the sub: be respectful, no personal attacks, no begging, no links to other social media platforms or videos, no promotions. People who break the rules can be removed and/or banned from the chat.

1nz7d9n,homeless,Recently Homeless and Struggling But Could Be Worse,"Hey all. I've been homeless for about a month or so now. I live with my younger sister in my SUV in my aunt's front yard. She and her husband let us come in for showers every now and then and to use the bathroom, we can wash our clothes and we can keep small items in her fridge. She's a good couponer, so if she scores a good enough deal on something, she'll give us one of it, and she's made sure to save us each a half of a taco on taco night, so we really could have it a lot worse. We've been in her yard for about 3 weeks give or take, and we have been eaten alive by mosquitoes, but she has neighbors who are cops, and it's meant to be a family friendly neighborhood, so I appreciate being able to keep the windows down at all.

 Sleeping in my driver's seat however as we figure out how to arrange my car better has caused me to develop severe bilateral edema, and my feet feel like they're going to burst. My toes often go numb. ER doctor was going to put me on Lasix, but with how many accidents I've had because my aunt wasn't awake and the door was locked, he decided against it. I also have an ear infection, so I can't hear out of my right ear. I was given information for a free medical clinic, but the next day, one of my tires went flat, so I'm coasting on my spare until I get paid. 

I had to give up substitute teaching, but I have a job I started last month that I really like and my manager is really understanding and helpful about my situation. I've applied for food stamps to hopefully get us by until I start to get more hours. I'm constantly worried about getting fired though because after about 2 hours, the pain and swelling in my feet is unbearable and I have to take several sit down breaks for the rest of the shift. I try to balance it by coming in early or on days off when they need me. My sister recently got hired for a job down the street from mine, so hopefully things start moving along for us. 

I'm very new to being homeless so I appreciate any tips or advice. We are okay on most fronts besides my aunt's husband pushing for a us to not be here and food. Again any advice or tips are appreciated. Thank you.

1nyvapj,homeless,Thinking of going to Los Angeles to be homeless.,"So my goal is to eventually get to Los Angeles!

I might have a new job with Amazon coming up if they can change the training schedule for me. If not then I will figure something out and to keep looking for a new job before I leave. I need at least $600-$800 before I leave for LA and to be homeless. I plan to get a bike there for transportation since the buses aren’t free.

This is my dream to be in LA. I’ve been wanting to move there since I was a teenager. I’m now 30 and living with roommates and it’s horrible. I want out ASAP. I plan to save up to $800 at the most and then I plan to leave. It might take me 8 months but the wait is worth it. I will try to save everything and to cut back on getting Dunkin/Coffee. That way I can move out faster!

I really need this job and my job appointment is tomorrow if I can make it. Wish me luck.

Edit: I may leave in 6 months so that’s about $600.

If anyone has any tips or suggestions of what is something helpful, or would make someone’s day I could put in there I’d love to know!

1lbrijj,homeless,Currently trapped in my storage unit,"I’m currently trapped in my storage unit after I’ve secretly been sleeping here for the past month due to being homeless. I heard the worker coming down the aisles and opening up several units for whatever reason. There’s also light sensors so I was able to see the lights cutting on as she moved down the aisles as well. I quickly set up everything and placed some covers and clothes to conceal myself. She gets to my aisle and obviously I don’t have the lock on the outside. I had a few items holding the door down and once she opened the unit I felt myself trembling as I was so nervous I was about to get caught. She called out and asked if anyone was inside but apparently she didn’t actually see me. I also don’t think they are allowed to actually enter the unit. I then heard her lock the unit and stand there for a minute, maybe to write something down. I stayed in this position for another hour until the lights cut off and I was sure she had left. Idk what I’m going to do cause now I’m stuck inside (currently 9pm) until the doors unlock at 6, and the workers come in at 9am. Even if I call them and ask them to remove the lock then I risk being found anyways and potentially kicked out/ trespassed. Not really asking any advice. Just leaving this here for anyone thinking about sleeping in their unit. It’s not worth it.

UPDATE - it is currently 8:16am and I was able to get out through the metal separators at the top of my unit due to a part of it being cut (not by me). I climbed the top of my unit by using my queen sized bed as a sort of ladder. I bent the metal netting in order to fit through and then had to push myself up, I’ll have to fix that but def a problem for another day. I had to use the very little arm strength I have to get myself up. As I sat on top of the netting, with an overview of all the units of my floor, I realized mine was the only one with this escape route on top of my unit so I guess I got extremely lucky in this regard. I was able to jump down from the top of my unit. I’m going to go back at 9:30am to ask them to take the lock off. I am now safe and out of the unit.

Another update - I went back and they unlocked it for me. They didn’t say a word about if I was in there or not and it was the same lady that almost caught me.

1m3g9sv,homeless,Sending my Dad a “Proof of Life” pizza,"My Dad was unhoused for about 10 years, but he’s been in a subsidized apartment for the last 2.

He’s been talking about going back to “living in nature” so naturally… I worry. Since he lives across the country, my strategy when I haven’t heard from him is to order a pizza and tip the delivery person really well with a note to let me know if my Dad receives the pie. Crossing my fingers this time he’s okay!

Update: He got it! The Door Dasher said he answered and “He’s doing alright.” I tipped the dasher $20.

I have never seen or experienced something so cruel in my life. There will be 100’s mentally sick homeless people in Los Angeles being thrown out to the streets on Monday.  I stay in a recuperative care in Los Angeles named SOUL HOUSING. They have different facilities across Los Angeles for men and women who have mental issues. They decided on Friday to give us about 70 mentally disabled homeless people a notice to leave the facility on Monday saying out medical cut us off out of the blue. I stay at the soul housing on 1540 South saint Andrews facility, which is by Venice blvd and western. Remember, this is not a homeless shelter. It’s a mental institution, the people here that are being thrown out are not mentally capable of navigating the streets.. and to make matters worse, they gave us the notice on Friday and almost all government social services and homeless services are closed on weekends, so we will be on the streets on Monday morning trying to figure out what to do. The facility I am staying are kicking out 70-80 people. They have different facilities so it will be in the 100’s mentally disabled people being kicked out to the streets in Los Angeles. There is lot of people crying here right now. They have no family or help. They are kicking out people that have no business being on the streets. There is a kid who has half of his brain cut out because of gun violence, he will be out on the streets tomorrow. I gave you the address and I will post a picture so you can see for yourself. We have a caravan of disabled people tomorrow morning heading to skid row. These people will be exposed to drugs and all the crazy stuff that happens in skid row. Please help us ….

I had a regular paying job for a few months, I didn't like the job but it paid for regular food and a room. Then 2 months ago I remember management started to ask me lots of questions about my past. I was reluctant to telling them anything for fear of getting fired. They acted friendly, told me a little about their personal life. Amd that made me feel like it was a safe space. I ended opening up to a manager about being homeless for a while, living on the streets. I thought nothing of it and I felt a little good to just say it to someone else, I'm mostly solitary and have no one to talk to. But I saw something in the manners and behavior change toward me.  A few days later I'm asked to have a meeting with management.  They sat me down, and basically said due to my history I'm no longer a good fit for the job. They took my badge and had me leave immediately.  This was a huge shock to me. I did everything correctly at this job and I never called out sick or showed up late. I asked them what I did wrong, but they said my time with the company is over and to pack my things. As I walked home, 4 miles, I was trying to figure out why they'd do this, why now, what did I do to deserve getting canned so abruptly.  Then it hit me, I told them I was homeless before. That's the only thing that changed. So now I'm worried again on what's going to happen. I have no job, I'm looking and I'm trying. I just wonder why I even said anything at all. 
So my advice is never tell anyone at all, don't tell anyone you work with in any way. I had a job, now I'm worried about how I'm going to have enough money to eat this week.

The manager, rarely returns calls or emails and it feels like i'm harassing them for an update every time I call. Mind you I have already paid a portion of my deposit and signed paperwork.

1hd3p9u,shelter,SAVE THIS DOG,"I don't know what else to do. He is a perfect angel and has had the worst luck. He was surrendered by his owner due to a housing issue (new apartment didn't allow dog's over 40 pound.) He caught a URI(similar to a dog cold) almost immediately after being dropped off at our shelter- which had to be treated until we could make him available for adoption. When he finally beat the cold, he was put on the adoptions floor and stayed there for over 90 days without interest. Patrons stated that he had a ""grumpy face."" He cannot help RBF- can any of us? During these 90 days, we used him for ""dog testing"" in which we test a dog's reactivity/ behavior towards other dogs. He was selected for this testing since he is so mild mannered and gets along with every dog & person. Due to human error, during a dog test, the other dog got loose and bit him aggressively, leaving several SEVERE puncture wounds. He was rushed to urgent veterinary care, and this again resulted in him being taken off of the adoption floor for treatment & recovery time. Through all of this, he REMAINED the most friendly dog towards all people & other dogs. Finally, once he was healthy enough to be put up for adoption, he was taken home and thought he had found his forever family. Unfortunately, after only being there for 11 days, he pooped on the front porch. The family decided- after this one incidence- that he was not house-trained, and they returned him to the shelter. This is a desperate plea- this baby deserves better. Due to his ""history"" and length of time spent in shelter, he will be euthanized. He does not deserve this. If I had any capability to take hi myself, I WOULD. I am posting this in a desperate final attempt that someone may read this and be able to provide the life that he deserves. I know I can personally relate to being dealt a shitty hand in life, but it seems even worse when it is at the hands of an undeserving animal- I hope this speaks to someone else <3 and if it does, you won't regret taking this beautiful soul into your life & home",2,1.0,0,2024-12-12 22:51:59,Hot_Stretch_6955,https://www.reddit.com/r/shelter/comments/1hd3p9u/save_this_dog/,True,hot,7140.673862152222,0.0,0.00028008561077136123,0.025522761552173322,0.6205522418757713,2063,386
1jowck6,housingcrisis,"94 Million Households Can’t Afford a $400,000 Home in USA — Report","
Less than 24 hours before Trump threatens to impose a global tariff on a raft of building materials—including lumber—the powerful National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has forecast that 94 million US households (70% of the market) cannot afford an average-priced house ($400,000) based on income thresholds and underwriting standards.

The findings come as part of a housing affordability pyramid published in the 2025 Priced-Out Analysis, revealing the number of households able to purchase a home at various price intervals: “The largest share of households falls within the first step, where homes are priced under $200,000. As home prices increase, fewer and fewer households can afford the next price level, with the highest-priced homes—those over $2 million—having the smallest number of potential buyers.”",500,0.99,199,2025-04-01 10:02:49,ChangeNarrow5633,https://woodcentral.com.au/94-million-households-cant-afford-a-400000-home-in-usa-report/,False,top,4513.493958782778,0.398,0.11077892306182295,0.11041666666666666,0.440625,888,135
1kw5sja,housingcrisis,Will housing become a pipe dream for the middle class and below?,"In 2025, the average home in the U.S. costs about $367,000—already a major leap from just ten years ago. But if current trends continue, experts project that figure could balloon to $800,000 or more by 2045.

This isn't just about inflation. Ongoing housing shortages in major cities, combined with rising demand and investor competition, are pushing prices even higher. Wages, meanwhile, haven't kept up.

If nothing changes—no significant wage growth, government intervention, or a major correction in the housing market—millions of people earning $50K–$80K annually could be locked out of homeownership entirely.

What does this mean for the middle class? Will we see a shift in how people define financial security or build generational wealth? And if buying a home becomes unattainable for so many, what alternatives do people have?

Would love to hear what others think: Are we heading toward a future where owning a home is only for the wealthy?",212,0.97,288,2025-05-26 17:16:08,Unfair_Today_511,https://www.reddit.com/r/housingcrisis/comments/1kw5sja/will_housing_become_a_pipe_dream_for_the_middle/,True,top,3186.272014669722,1.3584905660377358,0.06653543671850477,0.1236842105263158,0.45855263157894727,1017,164

I am already in my local Buy Nothing group and we plan on doing thrift shops as well! 

I have a lot of calls to make tomorrow because of the numerous comments here with other resources i didnt know existed!! 

I will for sure update again once we get into the place. We get keys and sign lease tomorrow (Tuesday) tjen move in Wednesday because thats the soonest Delmarva (my electric co) can turn on the power. I cant wait to share everything. I hope to never experience this kind of low again. I know it will be tough with new challenges now but this will work. It has to. 💙💙

Due to a horrible divorce a few years ago, my kids and i have been living in a motel. I work full time, dont quailfy for food stamps, paying an insane amount of rent and car payments, and kids with medical issues  etc made it impossible to find a rental. There was no way to save for the moving cost and down payments etc. BUT. Finally.  We found a rental. A realtor who owns a property.  Its small, but perfect. My kids can stay in their schools, its close to my work. And its less than this motel room!

I inquired about it and thankfully he has a heart and was willing to give me a much needed chance to prove im a good tenant who pays rent on time and im quiet. I dont party. I work, take care of my kids, sleep, then work again. (And im ok with that! My ideal Saturday night is jammies and movies with my babies and a Wednesday sandwhich picnic blowing bubbles etc)

We move in 2 days. I havent stopped crying. We have nothing to move with but we are finally moving up. It will all come in time. No furniture,  just our clothes. But its happening.
