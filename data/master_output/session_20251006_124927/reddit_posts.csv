Any posts outside of this thread will be removed. I know that this is stressful and there is a lot of fear and confusion about how this will be implemented and what it will actually mean. Because of that it is really important to keep this a **fact based** discussion. Posting unsubstantiated assumptions and speculative rumors is not helpful and only causes more confusion. 

It’s fine to talk about your opinions and feelings, but they need to be clearly framed as *opinions* and *feelings.* Any misinformation or obvious outrage bait will be removed. It’s important to evaluate the trustworthiness of your sources. If it feels like an article is trying to make you feel scared or angry, it may not be the most reliable source. 

Most importantly please be civil to each other. You can disagree with someone *without* resorting to personal attacks or name calling. You can hate someone’s opinion but still be respectful towards the person as a human being. Stay on topic and play nice everyone.

I’ve seen a few people talking about how there has been a lot of negativity on the sub lately. Maybe having a group chat will help us all get to know each other better and give us more empathy. Additionally with most of us dealing with cold, unpleasant weather for the next few months the group chat will give us a place to socialize and get some real-time human connection. 

So… at the top of the feed you should see a tab that says **chats.** You can click that and head in to General Homeless Chat to try it out. I plan on adding some fun events, games, or themes too, if you have an idea for something fun to do in the chat send me a message! 

Rules for the chat are basically the same as in the sub: be respectful, no personal attacks, no begging, no links to other social media platforms or videos, no promotions. People who break the rules can be removed and/or banned from the chat.

1nz7d9n,homeless,Recently Homeless and Struggling But Could Be Worse,"Hey all. I've been homeless for about a month or so now. I live with my younger sister in my SUV in my aunt's front yard. She and her husband let us come in for showers every now and then and to use the bathroom, we can wash our clothes and we can keep small items in her fridge. She's a good couponer, so if she scores a good enough deal on something, she'll give us one of it, and she's made sure to save us each a half of a taco on taco night, so we really could have it a lot worse. We've been in her yard for about 3 weeks give or take, and we have been eaten alive by mosquitoes, but she has neighbors who are cops, and it's meant to be a family friendly neighborhood, so I appreciate being able to keep the windows down at all.

 Sleeping in my driver's seat however as we figure out how to arrange my car better has caused me to develop severe bilateral edema, and my feet feel like they're going to burst. My toes often go numb. ER doctor was going to put me on Lasix, but with how many accidents I've had because my aunt wasn't awake and the door was locked, he decided against it. I also have an ear infection, so I can't hear out of my right ear. I was given information for a free medical clinic, but the next day, one of my tires went flat, so I'm coasting on my spare until I get paid. 

I had to give up substitute teaching, but I have a job I started last month that I really like and my manager is really understanding and helpful about my situation. I've applied for food stamps to hopefully get us by until I start to get more hours. I'm constantly worried about getting fired though because after about 2 hours, the pain and swelling in my feet is unbearable and I have to take several sit down breaks for the rest of the shift. I try to balance it by coming in early or on days off when they need me. My sister recently got hired for a job down the street from mine, so hopefully things start moving along for us. 

I'm very new to being homeless so I appreciate any tips or advice. We are okay on most fronts besides my aunt's husband pushing for a us to not be here and food. Again any advice or tips are appreciated. Thank you.

I might have a new job with Amazon coming up if they can change the training schedule for me. If not then I will figure something out and to keep looking for a new job before I leave. I need at least $600-$800 before I leave for LA and to be homeless. I plan to get a bike there for transportation since the buses aren’t free.

I plan to save up to $800 at the most and then I plan to leave. It might take me 8 months but the wait is worth it. I will try to save everything and to cut back on getting Dunkin/Coffee. That way I can move out faster!

I really need this job and my job appointment is tomorrow if I can make it. Wish me luck.

1nywc83,homeless,"Need urgent advice: cousin stranded in LaGrange, Georgia with two disabled kids","Hi everyone,

I’m hoping someone here can point me in the right direction. My cousin is currently stranded in LaGrange, Georgia after her car broke down at a gas station.

She has two disabled children — one is nonverbal with autism and ADHD, and the other has cerebral palsy.

She’s bipolar and currently off medication (not judging, just giving context). She moved to Georgia while in a manic state and is now trying to return home to Oklahoma. Unfortunately, she only has $29 to her name.

I was able to send her $35 for food through DoorDash, but that’s all I can do right now. Her father is refusing to help, and I’m really worried the kids might end up sleeping in the car or at the gas station tonight.

Does anyone know of resources or organizations in LaGrange or nearby areas that can help with emergency shelter, transportation, or family assistance?
Even local churches, mutual aid groups, or community programs would help so much.

I’m not saying she isn’t accountable — I just don’t want her children to be sleeping outside tonight.

Thank you so much for any advice or direction you can give. ❤️

Here's a source for that from the ACLU https://www.aclu.org/news/criminal-law-reform/if-youre-white-youre-customer-if-youre-black 
If you live in Michigan, I ask you to please contact them as I did explaining why the rules should not be changed. Here is their website Michigan.gov/ROWRules
and their email 
MDOT-PublicComments@michigan.gov 
Here is a citation for a Michigan lower court decision that said panhandling is covered under free speech laws https://share.google/8aDFFdU1cM81hI5jb 
Here is the body of the email I already sent them: Peaceful panhandling is legal in Michigan and should remain so, even at rest areas, especially in these hard times. People who stay at rest areas overnight do so because they have no other place to go. By passing these new rules, no one would be addressing those problems; the problems would just be moved somewhere else.

He Happily stays out later with friends (12-1am), whereas with me and around 8pm he will make it VERY clear he wants to go home. 

One saturday I was having an AWFULLY hard night. He offered I stay in the car, I could tell it was a really last minute offer just to be nice, I declined. He said “I’ll put stuff in the car for nights you feel like this” I said ok. Another Saturday (memorial weekends) came around I hinted I reallly didn’t wanna leave the safety and comfort of his car, he said “I just don’t know where to park and unsure about (something else I’m forgetting now)”. I immediately took the hint and said never mind and apologized, he dropped me at my usual park. 

Like I said, I’m working 10-13hr days. He doesn’t have a job right now but he’s transferred colleges and is finding a pace. But again.. he’s hanging out with friends just fine. 

I understand the age may have a lot more to do with it than I initially realized. I’m just starting to feel like i want more attention from HIM. I get hit on A Lot at the shop I work at, I get free stuff, good tips. And they don’t even know I’m homless!!! 

But I don’t want attention from those people I want it from my significant other that knows I don’t have a bed every night and knows I can’t shower every night and knows how exhausted I am and knows how much ONE HOUR of laying in his car would change my night.

I’m debating telling him. But it’s so close to our one year. I found myself crushing on someone I work with, I would NEVER ever ever do anything to compromise my morals or disrespect my SO.

1lbrijj,homeless,Currently trapped in my storage unit,"I’m currently trapped in my storage unit after I’ve secretly been sleeping here for the past month due to being homeless. I heard the worker coming down the aisles and opening up several units for whatever reason. There’s also light sensors so I was able to see the lights cutting on as she moved down the aisles as well. I quickly set up everything and placed some covers and clothes to conceal myself. She gets to my aisle and obviously I don’t have the lock on the outside. I had a few items holding the door down and once she opened the unit I felt myself trembling as I was so nervous I was about to get caught. She called out and asked if anyone was inside but apparently she didn’t actually see me. I also don’t think they are allowed to actually enter the unit. I then heard her lock the unit and stand there for a minute, maybe to write something down. I stayed in this position for another hour until the lights cut off and I was sure she had left. Idk what I’m going to do cause now I’m stuck inside (currently 9pm) until the doors unlock at 6, and the workers come in at 9am. Even if I call them and ask them to remove the lock then I risk being found anyways and potentially kicked out/ trespassed. Not really asking any advice. Just leaving this here for anyone thinking about sleeping in their unit. It’s not worth it.

UPDATE - it is currently 8:16am and I was able to get out through the metal separators at the top of my unit due to a part of it being cut (not by me). I climbed the top of my unit by using my queen sized bed as a sort of ladder. I bent the metal netting in order to fit through and then had to push myself up, I’ll have to fix that but def a problem for another day. I had to use the very little arm strength I have to get myself up. As I sat on top of the netting, with an overview of all the units of my floor, I realized mine was the only one with this escape route on top of my unit so I guess I got extremely lucky in this regard. I was able to jump down from the top of my unit. I’m going to go back at 9:30am to ask them to take the lock off. I am now safe and out of the unit.

Another update - I went back and they unlocked it for me. They didn’t say a word about if I was in there or not and it was the same lady that almost caught me. Moral of the story, I won’t ever do that again.",551,0.98,172,2025-06-15 00:15:47,Any-Tap9311,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/1lbrijj/currently_trapped_in_my_storage_unit/,True,top,2724.801846438889,0.3121597096188748,0.2022165394228999,0.06989197530864197,0.39037037037037037,2366,481
1m3g9sv,homeless,Sending my Dad a “Proof of Life” pizza,"My Dad was unhoused for about 10 years, but he’s been in a subsidized apartment for the last 2.

He’s been talking about going back to “living in nature” so naturally… I worry. Since he lives across the country, my strategy when I haven’t heard from him is to order a pizza and tip the delivery person really well with a note to let me know if my Dad receives the pie. Crossing my fingers this time he’s okay!

Update: He got it! The Door Dasher said he answered and “He’s doing alright.” I tipped the dasher $20.

1lchk70,homeless,100’s of disabled homeless being thrown out to the streets of L.A.,"This has been one of the most painful weekends in my life. I have never seen or experienced something so cruel in my life. There will be 100’s mentally sick homeless people in Los Angeles being thrown out to the streets on Monday.  I stay in a recuperative care in Los Angeles named SOUL HOUSING. They have different facilities across Los Angeles for men and women who have mental issues. They decided on Friday to give us about 70 mentally disabled homeless people a notice to leave the facility on Monday saying out medical cut us off out of the blue. I stay at the soul housing on 1540 South saint Andrews facility, which is by Venice blvd and western. Remember, this is not a homeless shelter. It’s a mental institution, the people here that are being thrown out are not mentally capable of navigating the streets.. and to make matters worse, they gave us the notice on Friday and almost all government social services and homeless services are closed on weekends, so we will be on the streets on Monday morning trying to figure out what to do. The facility I am staying are kicking out 70-80 people. They have different facilities so it will be in the 100’s mentally disabled people being kicked out to the streets in Los Angeles. There is lot of people crying here right now. They have no family or help. They are kicking out people that have no business being on the streets. There is a kid who has half of his brain cut out because of gun violence, he will be out on the streets tomorrow. I gave you the address and I will post a picture so you can see for yourself. We have a caravan of disabled people tomorrow morning heading to skid row. These people will be exposed to drugs and all the crazy stuff that happens in skid row. Please help us ….

The plant manager offered me the weld supervisor job with a bump in pay ( another 3$ an hour ) and I just felt so much pride that they see me as someone capable of handling this much responsibility.

1mz6n9y,homeless,Don't share that you're homeless at a job!!!,"Don't share that you're homeless at a job.
I had a regular paying job for a few months, I didn't like the job but it paid for regular food and a room. Then 2 months ago I remember management started to ask me lots of questions about my past. I was reluctant to telling them anything for fear of getting fired. They acted friendly, told me a little about their personal life. Amd that made me feel like it was a safe space. I ended opening up to a manager about being homeless for a while, living on the streets. I thought nothing of it and I felt a little good to just say it to someone else, I'm mostly solitary and have no one to talk to. But I saw something in the manners and behavior change toward me.  A few days later I'm asked to have a meeting with management.  They sat me down, and basically said due to my history I'm no longer a good fit for the job. They took my badge and had me leave immediately.  This was a huge shock to me. I did everything correctly at this job and I never called out sick or showed up late. I asked them what I did wrong, but they said my time with the company is over and to pack my things. As I walked home, 4 miles, I was trying to figure out why they'd do this, why now, what did I do to deserve getting canned so abruptly.  Then it hit me, I told them I was homeless before. That's the only thing that changed. So now I'm worried again on what's going to happen. I have no job, I'm looking and I'm trying. I just wonder why I even said anything at all. 
So my advice is never tell anyone at all, don't tell anyone you work with in any way. I had a job, now I'm worried about how I'm going to have enough money to eat this week.

1l89tgi,homeless,Idaho made it illegal to sleep in your car. I lived in mine for 9 months just to survive.,"I lived in my car in Boise for nine months. That car was my bedroom, my only safe place, and the only reason I made it through the worst time of my life. I was not camping. I was surviving.

Idaho passed a law called SB1141 that makes it illegal to sleep in public, even in your own car, if you are unhoused. They are calling it an anti-camping law, but it is really an anti-survival law. It punishes people for not having housing.

If this law had existed when I was going through it, I could have been ticketed, arrested, or pushed into even more dangerous situations. Instead of getting punished, I got help. I am now housed and stable, but I would not be here if I had not been able to rest safely in my car.

This law goes into effect on July 1. I am speaking out now because I want others to have the same chance I did. I started a petition to stop it.

1mb9wi7,homeless,My bf doesn’t know I’m homeless,"I 27(F) used pretty much the last bit of money I had from my last work paycheck to buy a flight from California to stay in South Carolina with my boyfriend for a bit. He still doesn’t know that I’m homeless and have been for the last 8 months. Today he asked me when did I think I wanted to leave. Not in a way that makes me feel he wants me to go, just asking. I lost my ID before I came here and was hoping to get a new one mailed before I left since I don’t have an address to get the replacement sent back once I get home, he obv doesn’t know that. I told him that as soon as my ID came I’d leave so I didn’t have to deal with the long TSA process. This was the longest time in the last 8 months that I’ve been able to just rest, sleep in an actual bed, and eat home cooked meals everyday. He doesn’t know how much this has been such a relief on my mental health, my body. I’ve been the perfect house gf though so he’s not urging me to go. I cook, clean, give him his space to play his video games, messages, anything he wants cause I appreciate him so much. But I don’t want to overstay my welcome, and everyday I feel bad that I’m basically lying to him. I don’t think he’d love me any less but I’m very ashamed of my situation. I have no clue what I’ll do once I get back to LA but I’m not looking forward to being cold and on the streets again.

Update - So I left my bfs about a week ago and I’m back in LA. To answer some questions no I did not tell him yet. Also I asked him if he said it because he wanted me to leave and he actually did not and was pretty upset that I assumed he wanted me to leave. He is currently begging me to come back and just move in with him. Although I’m homeless I feel like it’s too soon to move in together as we’ve only been together for 3 months now.

Only bright side was that my girlfriend was in the next cell over so we could talk to her we sang a bunch of songs it was kind of fun.

Then they released us all together didn’t even tell us we were cited. Had to look in my belongings to find the citation which says I have to go to court for being in a park after hours.

I only get a few hundred dollars a month while I wait for my SSDI, I’m physically and mentally disabled so my healthcare worker says there is a homeless court here in Orange County that will take this off my record if she writes me a letter saying that I am homeless and disabled but that I am getting treatment and trying to get housing.

1iaco99,homeless,My weirdest homeless experience,"So this happened back in 2015 when I aged out of foster care. 

I floated around for awhile with nothing but the clothes on my back, a wool blanket I got from an ambulance & my backpack. Cold & starving I walked to a park & crashed out. 

I always hung out at this park because no one ever came around & it was peaceful & safe. 

After I crashed out for about an hour, something woke me up. Maybe it was a 6th sense, who knows. I started to look around & noticed this guy standing by some picnic tables about 25 yards from me. This guy looked like a skinnier version of Glenn from the show Superstore. He was staring right at me & invited me over for a meal as if he knew I was starving. 

So I reluctantly joined him. I say reluctantly because I was 18 living on the streets for the first time & a lot of people said I looked 14 due to my baby face. Therefore I was extremely cautious around people. The food was really good, it was some type of Pasta dish with bread on the side that he cooked up on the spot with a Coleman stove. 

We talked about a lot of things, mostly my time spent in the foster system. He did at one point ask me if I was religious & I said no. Luckily he left it at that. The whole thing was strange to me. Here's this guy who came out of nowhere, fed me & now I'm opening up to him about my past. Something I have never done, not even in Foster Care. 

After about an hour, I got up to take a piss behind a tree & grab my backpack. When I looked back over to the table, he was gone. I looked around for him but the nearest parking lot was about 100 yards away. Not even a vehicle was leaving. I then noticed something was left at the table. It was a sleeping bag & a Bible with $200 in it as well as a piece of paper with all the local resources on it. 

I'm not sure who this guy was or how he disappeared so quickly but he really did help me. I don't think I would be here today if it wasn't for him.

1n0rtns,homeless,Terminated after they found out I was homeless,"So I found a job!!! Yay! Money for things, food clothes, phone, etc. It was on a construction project in my town. They are replacing a bridge. I had never done construction before and was really enjoying it. I was learning new skills. How to operate an excavator for example. Its not as hard as I thought it would be. Anyway the superintendent is a vet with severe PTSD. He would periodically start telling us about his time in the army and start crying saying we have to make sure have each brothers back and safety first etc. I really thought he had a good heart and genuinely gave a shit about others. I was wrong!!

 He happens to drive by one morning when I was coming out of the woods from my camp about a half mile away and saw me. I got drilled with questions as soon as I arrived. And being the treating dumbest that I am I opened up and told him that I was yes homeless, but that I was saving and would be out of this situation soon because of this job. I thanked him and thought that was the end of it. Again I was wrong. A week later our project gets shut down and the crew gets sent about 2 hrs away to another job. My foreman tells me that I need ti gets ride there. I tried but to no avail. He told me that if I couldn't make it it would be 2 weeks before worked started up again and I would not wait till then. I was unhappy about it but what are you gonna do. 

On the following week on Thursday I get a  text from the super telling me my check was at the office(which is in another state about 1.5 hrs away) and I would need to pick it up. Okay challenging but not impossible. The next day Friday I call the office to ensure someone will be there and I'm told that my check was mailed to my address on file and I was terminated for no call no show. WTF!!!.?

I was downvoted into oblivion by saying that homeless people are frequently poisoned, so you should only hand out items in tamper-evident packaging. The exception would be if you're part of an accredited organization, which this random dude clearly wasn't.

Furthermore, if it isn't something you personally wouldn't eat, you're a jerk if you think a homeless person would like to eat it instead! In the US there is an abundance of food and most unhoused people receive EBT, so very few are actually starving. If they are hungry, they'd be better off eating ramen noodles than something that could harm them. People think it's kind to hand out their old garbage which couldn't be further from the truth.

Ditto to grocery stores who donate their 5 day old baked goods and deli items to food pantries. The last thing someone going through Hell needs is to get food poisoning from moldy old ham.

Hi. I don’t even know where to begin. I’m a woman in my mid-thirties and I’ve been living in my car ever since my ex broke up with me three months ago—right after I lost my job. We were together for five years. I thought we were building a life together. I thought we were partners.

But when I got laid off—through no fault of my own, the company just moved operations—everything crumbled. Instead of standing by me, he left. I had nowhere to go. No friends or family nearby. Now I’m in my car, sleeping in parking lots, completely lost.

I’m just spiraling. I can’t make sense of how someone who shared five years of life with me could just watch me fall apart like this. He’s living comfortably, and I’m struggling to survive.

I keep thinking, why is this happening? I didn’t cheat. I didn’t lie. I just had anxiety, and I needed reassurance. Maybe I didn’t handle everything perfectly, but I was loyal and I loved him.

Please, I just need someone to read this. I’ve been writing more about my story on my profile if you want to know what’s been going on. I’m trying to hold on.

1naaj1x,homeless,accidentally got 4 big Cinnabons instead of 4 minis and now I feel guilty,"Since I have been homeless for a while now, I can usually tell when someone else is too, even if they do not look it in the stereotypical way. Today I was looking for free food apps and saw that Cinnabon gives you 4 minibons with your first order. I figured out I could just buy a sauce for $0.99 to redeem it, so my total came to $1.30. When I went to pick it up, they handed me a big bag. I repeated my name, and they said, ""yes, this is your order."" I checked the receipt and it was definitely mine, but when I opened the bag, instead of 4 tiny rolls, it was 4 of the big classic ones. At first I wanted to go back and tell them, but since the sauce I ordered was in there too, I knew it was not someone else’s order, just a mix-up. I felt guilty but decided to keep it. The pack was not heated, so I went to the other Cinnabon in the mall (for some reason there were two) and asked if they could warm them up and put them in separate boxes. The employee was really kind and did it for me.

I ate one and gave the other three to people sitting in the food court who I could tell were also homeless. They did not really look it, but I could tell, and they were thankful. Still, I felt guilty afterward because I know how much some of us try to hide our situation, and by giving them food I felt like I was exposing it. Even though they appreciated it, I could not shake that feeling. I am still not sure if I did the right thing especially since it was only dessert and not a real meal.

1hmzc56,homeless,"Jaden Smith’s food trucks located in Los Angelos and Harlem, New York City, New York gives away free food to feed the homeless ","For his 21st birthday back in 2019, Jaden Smith, son of famed actor Will Smith, decided to celebrate with the launch of his series of ‘I Love You’ vegan food trucks that provide free, healthy, and sustainable meals to the homeless community of Skid Row in Los Angeles.

Now, 22-year-old Smith wants to expand his food truck movement to a full-blown vegan restaurant that will continue to give free meals to the unsheltered. If you’re not homeless, don’t worry, you can still eat at Smith’s restaurant, but according to him, “not only do you have to pay, but you have to pay for more than the food’s worth so that you can pay for the person behind you.”

Smith hasn’t yet revealed when his new restaurant will open nor where it will be located, but he’s instructed his followers to “keep a lookout.”

On top of his vegan food truck initiative, Smith and his father own the Just Water company that addresses the contamination of the main water system in Flint, Michigan. He’s also in collaboration with 501CTHREE.org’s Water Box project that provides access to clean water for communities in need.

The young actor and musician hopes that his two-year-long effort to feed disadvantaged communities will “[give] people what they deserve, healthy vegan food for free.” There is a lot of talk about how the maintenance of a healthy and sustainable life is not as accessible to the underprivileged. Smith’s vegan food trucks work to close this gap by feeding thousands of people in Los Angeles, as well as the unsheltered in Harlem, New York.

I'd go to the DMV when it was crowded and say I needed to replace my license. I'd get a number and wait. When my number was close to being called, I'd approach someone who had just arrived and offer to swap numbers if they paid me. I targeted people who looked like they had disposable income. 

I found I could make forty or fifty bucks in a matter of hours, and it offered the added bonus of a warm place to hang out. It worked until I mentioned it to a friend, who blew up my spot by going in there every day smelling like a diaper full of shrimp. 

I was inspired to share this because I'm sitting at the DMV right now. I'm barely scraping by, but I'd still happily throw someone a fiver if it meant I didn't have to sit here for another half an hour.

I was looking for a library to charge my phone and I found one. One day I was sitting at the gas station across from The library chillin and this fine ass cop rolls up asks me what I'm doing, minding my business I reply. He laughs and asks me if I was homeless and if so he had connections to get me into housing. I gave him my number and he called a couple of hours later. I met him and this chick who works for the Sherrifs homeless division.

I was given two nights in a hotel and the first night the cop calls me to ask where I was. I was a bit unnerved but I told him. He asked if he could stop by. Nervously I say sure (my fantasy is sleeping with a fine ass cop)
He showed up in his uniform looking like a midnight snack and smelling so good. 
Me showered and ready to go until he came in, showed me I had a warrant for my arrest in another county. I was nervous as he gave me a big hug, me looking up at him (Im 5'7 him 6'5) and that's when it felt all wrong. Like I saw his aura and I began to back up and out of his embrace. 
His aura was obsidian black. Like black black and I knew do not give him my body. 

He caught on and left. I double locked the door and had a difficult time going to sleep. 

Afterwards it felt weird seeing him. One day he told me that if I didn't off the streets that he would make my life a living hell. All of a sudden my things are stolen. Four different times. One morning I had gotten violently ill and on the verge of throwing up at the bus stop. I ran to the park bathroom to throw up. I saw him pull him talking rather curt to me. Rolling up his window I ran to the bathroom. 
He called twice while I was throwing up. I get back to the bus stop and my things were gone from the bus stop. This sorry sack of shit sent my things to the city yard! I called him back and screamed wtf. This bastard saying it's illegal for my things to be where they were (mind you no other cops said anything but him) and I could get my things. 

Needless to say I never got my things back, too expensive at the city yard. 
I about lost my mind. Contemplating suicide. Every time someone asked me where was my wagon with my things I had to hold back tears saying the cop took em away. When I finally said his name, those same people said OH! We know him. He loves harrassing the homeless and a creep to women.

How is it even acceptable that we, as a society, have allowed homelessness to exist? We have a duty to help the most vulnerable, especially those who became homeless due to circumstances beyond their control.

What about sensitive individuals who couldn’t keep up with the crushing demands of capitalism? What about those who were abused by their own families and thrown into a world that never gave them a chance? Some of these people feel everything deeply, yet society turns a blind eye to them as if they are invisible.

Why do we not care enough about innocent people? Many of them are just a street or two away from us—real human beings suffering in plain sight. And before someone tells me, “There’s nothing we can do,” that’s simply not true. We can create mutual aid communities. We can build systems that lift people out of homelessness.

Homelessness: The Truth People Don’t Want to Hear

A lot of people have no clue what’s really going on with homelessness. Conservatives keep saying, “There’s so much housing. There are so many free services. It’s easy for homeless people to get jobs. They just don’t want help, that’s why they suffer.” In a few cases, maybe that’s true. But it’s not that black and white. I’m going to tell you what’s really happening.

Jobs and the Reality of Hiring

First, let’s talk about jobs. I’ve volunteered to help homeless people with job searches, and I’ve spoken to career counselors who work with them. It’s not easy. One career counselor told me that out of all the homeless people her company helps with resumes and applications, free of charge, only about 3% actually land a job.

There’s a saying in the homeless community: “They want workers, they just don’t want us.” If you have bad teeth, bad skin, a history of drug use, poor hygiene because you live on the street, retail won’t hire you. Why? Because corporations want “pretty” people to stand in front of customers, people they can pay pennies to make shoppers feel good about spending money. Hiring someone who looks like they’ve suffered years on the street doesn’t fit that image.

Add to this the way modern HR systems work. Automated systems now flag applicants with inconsistent work history, criminal records, or anything that looks “risky.” Back in the 1970s, employers sometimes took chances on people because there was still a sense of loyalty and community. Today, corporations see every employee as a liability. If the algorithm says you’re a risk, you’re automatically screened out. You don’t even get a call back.

I’ve personally known people with college degrees who applied for over 3,000 jobs and never landed a single one.

The Trap of the System

People love to say, “It’s easy to get a job if you just try.” But that’s simply not true, especially today. AI is eliminating jobs, while AI-powered HR software pushes homeless applicants to the bottom of the stack. Even if someone spends hundreds of hours applying, they might never get hired.

Meanwhile, politicians are talking about limiting social services to those who are employed. Imagine that: you’re already suffering, already rejected from every job, and now they want to cut off your healthcare and the few survival programs that exist. If you get injured, you’re left with nothing, no surgery, no disability, no desk job, no insurance, no future. It’s a vicious cycle: you need a job to get healthcare, but you need healthcare to heal so you can work.

This is the horror of the American system.

Policing the Homeless

States briefly backed off chasing the homeless when the population grew too large to control, but now enforcement is back with a vengeance. As housing costs rise and services shrink, populations swell and the crackdown intensifies.

I’ll never forget my own experience. In 2003, I hitchhiked across California. One night, in Red Bluff, I tried to get a ride to Susanville. A man offered me a lift. He realized I wasn’t a drug addict and told me, “I have to get you out of this life before it destroys you.” He was part of a prison gang. Before he could help me, he got into a fight, fled the police, and disappeared.

His friends, also homeless, let me sleep under a bridge. They didn’t steal from me. They didn’t harm me. But that night, the police swarmed the riverbanks with boats and searchlights, hunting people like animals. These weren’t drug dealers or criminals. Many had jobs. But to the authorities, they were prey.

I’ll never forget how much it felt like a scene from Terminator, the machines sweeping the city, hunting humans in the night. To many homeless people, government authorities feel exactly like that: unthinking robots, following orders, hunting them down.

Shelters Are Not a Solution

Shelters, we’re told, are the “safe” solution. In reality, they’re often more dangerous than prisons. A study in California found you’re ten times more likely to be sexually assaulted in a homeless shelter than in jail.

Why? Because shelters are understaffed, overcrowded, and lack security. Multiple beds crammed into one room, no privacy, and predators everywhere. Many homeless people avoid shelters entirely, knowing it’s safer to sleep under a bridge than in a room full of desperate strangers.

If we wanted shelters to work, they’d have private rooms, private bathrooms, proper screenings, and real staff oversight. Instead, they’ve become holding pens that breed trauma.

Funding, Jails, and the Game of Passing the Buck

Here’s what most Americans don’t know: nobody wants to pay for homelessness. Cities push the burden onto counties, counties push it onto states, and states push it onto the federal government. Everyone plays hot potato with human lives.

That’s one reason governors support Trump. They think federal “solutions” will take the problem off their budgets. But Trump’s answer isn’t funding shelters or mental health services. His administration is talking about “camps,” facilities with 12 people per bathroom, no oversight, and conditions worse than prisons. Death camps in everything but name.

And this isn’t new. After the Civil War, when the South couldn’t legally own slaves anymore, they criminalized poverty. Minor “felonies” like spitting on the sidewalk turned poor people, mostly freed slaves but also poor whites, into forced labor for the state. It’s estimated 30% of those imprisoned in the post-war South died in these camps. That system of criminalized poverty and modern slavery has never really gone away.

Where We Stand Now

So ask yourself: is Trump reviving this system of forced enslavement, just modernized? Is that why governors quietly back him, because they’d rather shift the cost and moral responsibility to the federal government, even if it means camps and death?

Why don’t we just do the obvious thing: give people jobs, healthcare, and dignity before they’re desperate? Why should someone have to commit a crime to get the same basic services prisons already provide? Why is it easier for an ex-convict to get housing than a struggling, law-abiding citizen?

We don’t need genocide. We don’t need enslavement. We don’t need a future where America becomes a machine that crushes its own people.

I won't lie and say I wasn't tempted to just pocket it and walk away because it would have made a world of a difference to someone like me. 

No one else had noticed so I easily could have gotten away with it, but I just didn't have it in me. I ran up to him to give it to him. I held out the money and explained that I saw it fall out of his pocket. He checked his pockets then snatched it from my hand and he threatened to call the cops on me because according to him, the fact that I had his money means I must have pick pocketed him. I just said you are welcome and walked away. Why would I steal money then return it? I don't know if he was hostile because of how I look.

I've lost a lot of weight since I became homeless so my clothes don't fit that well and because I don't sleep well, my face looks it. I do try my best to look clean and presentable though because I am lucky enough to have found a part time job that I just can't afford to lose. I don't even know why I am trying to rationalize his behavior, deep down I know that it doesn't even matter how I looked to him, a normal person wouldn't have acted the way he did. The whole experience just left me feeling deflated.

1nmp48b,homeless,The 10 Commandments of Homelessness,"Here are the 10 Commandments of Homelessness — the most critical truths and survival strategies to hold onto when you first find yourself unhoused. This is about staying alive, staying human, and staying smart.

The 10 Commandments of Homelessness

1. Ditch Your Pride — Keep Your Dignity

Pride will get you hurt, ignored, or passed over for help. You don’t have time for shame. But don’t confuse that with giving up your self-respect. Always carry yourself with dignity, even if you haven’t showered in three days. You’re still you — no matter where you sleep.

2. Make Safety Your First Religion

Your number one job is to stay safe. Not warm. Not comfortable. Not well-fed. Safe. Scope out every spot before you settle in. Trust your gut. Don’t let exhaustion trick you into taking dumb risks. Where you sleep, who you trust, what you carry — it all matters.

3. Protect Your ID Like It’s Gold

Your ID is the key to everything: food, shelter, a job, benefits, and eventually getting out. Memorize the number. Make copies if you can. Put it in a Ziploc and keep it close — even when you sleep. Replace it immediately if it's lost.

4. Learn to Travel Light, Pack Smart

Every ounce counts. Everything you carry should serve a purpose — shelter, warmth, food, water, hygiene, documentation, tools. No dead weight. No “just in case” items. If it doesn’t serve your survival, ditch it.

5. Stay Clean — As Clean as You Can

Hygiene is more than comfort. It’s mental clarity, self-worth, and public perception. Clean socks prevent infection. Baby wipes buy you dignity. A clean look can mean the difference between getting help or being dismissed. Shower when and where you can.

6. Trust Cautiously — But Find Allies

Not everyone on the street is dangerous, but not everyone is safe either. The rules of trust are different now. Test people before you believe them. But once you find someone who has your back? Keep them close. A good ally can save your life.

7. Eat Every Chance You Get

Don’t turn down food. Don’t assume you’ll find some later. Hunger clouds your thinking, weakens your body, and steals your spirit. Whether it’s a food pantry, a stranger’s kindness, or a church plate — take it. Store it. Share it if you can.

8. Stay Invisible When You Need To Be

The less you’re seen, the less you’re targeted. Blend in when you must. Move with intention. Don’t loiter where you sleep. Don’t make enemies where you eat. Watch the quiet ones — they’ve usually been out here the longest for a reason.

9. Learn the System, Then Use It

Get familiar with local shelters, food banks, hygiene stations, and churches. Know who does what and what time. Learn what documents you need for housing apps or job help. Take free classes. Use public libraries. Use everything. You're not a burden — you're a human being trying to survive a rigged system.

10. Don’t Let the Street Rewrite You

You may live outside, but you are not less than. You are not garbage. You are not disposable. This system wants you to believe you’re the problem — you’re not. Keep your heart, your humor, your humanity. This world is broken, not you.

To,
The Officer In-charge,
Directorate of Town & Country Planning (DTCP) / RERA Office,
Gurugram, Haryana

Subject: Complaint regarding delay in possession of flat – Aashiyara Society, Sector 37C, Gurugram

Respected Sir/Madam,

I am writing this complaint on behalf of the allottees of Aashiyara Affordable Housing Project, Sector 37C, Gurugram. The builder had committed to hand over possession of the flats by January 2023, but till date only around 70% of the work has been completed.

This project is registered under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Affordable Housing Scheme), yet the beneficiaries are suffering badly due to the inaction and negligence of the builder. Despite repeated follow-ups, no concrete timeline has been provided for possession.

It is extremely disheartening that DTCP and RERA officials appear to be favouring the builder, while the common man continues to suffer. The buyers are under tremendous financial pressure as they are simultaneously paying EMIs on bank loans, house rent, and children’s school fees.

We therefore request you to kindly:

1. Take strict action against the builder for non-compliance with possession timelines.


2. Impose penalties as per RERA guidelines.


3. Ensure a clear and time-bound schedule for completion and possession.


4. Safeguard the interests of buyers under the Affordable Housing Scheme.



We hope that the administration will take our grievance seriously and provide us timely justice.

Yours sincerely,
Bikram singh

1n7gu7g,affordablehousing,"Niagara Falls, NY: Affordable Homes, Big Potential, Needs Urban Pioneers","Niagara Falls, NY has been in free-fall for decades. Population halved since the 1960s, industry collapsed, and the city government leaned too hard on casino money. The Canadian side boomed with tourism while the U.S. side withered.

Here’s the thing: the bones are still here.
- Homes selling for $40k - $90k, sometimes less
- Classic brick duplexes and small single-families with solid structure
- Access to cheap hydropower (some of the lowest electric rates in the country)
- Walkability around downtown if it were cared for
- Proximity to Buffalo’s resurgence, the border, and natural beauty like the gorge and the Falls themselves

What’s missing? People who actually want to live here and build community. Right now, most tourists drive in, see the Falls, and leave. Locals have fled. It’s a hollowed-out city with real potential but no critical mass.

Imagine:
- Affordable live-work spaces for artists, makers, and remote workers priced out of big cities
- Rehabbed duplexes rented to young families who want stability
- A new culture of small cafes, breweries, and galleries along the riverfront
- Energy-intensive startups (data centers, indoor farming, battery recycling) powered by cheap hydro

Challenges. You’d be dealing with poverty, disinvestment, city politics, and perception. But the upside is strong for those willing to be early. Buffalo is already seeing a comeback. Niagara Falls could follow, if enough people who care show up.

Curious if anyone here has lived in Niagara Falls or invested there. Do you see the same opportunity?

1n41sto,affordablehousing,Petition for affordable housing!,"Some people have said to me ""I was able to buy my home cheaper than that. You can too.""
But not everyone's reality is the same for everyone else. Yes, there are new home communities you can get into at a high cost and sometimes you have to leave your target area, and if you make a large down payment, sure! Your mortgage cost will be cheaper. 

But the reality is, this is not an option for everyone. 

There are MANY young people struggling out here for affordable housing. Rent is too high. Kids are living with their parents well into their 20s because they can't afford to be out on their own. Cost of living in general is too high (groceries, gas, insurance, clothes, cars). But it starts with cost of housing. 

In 1985, the median U.S. home price was around $82,000 (≈3x the median household income).

In 2025, the median home price is around $420,000+ (≈6–8x median income).

This makes buying a first home much harder for millennials than it was for Boomers or even early Gen X

Millennials are also marrying and having children later or sometimes not at all, because they can’t afford homes, childcare (often >$1,200/month), or medical bills for pregnancy

Another issue is people and companies buying up multiple houses to rent at high costs or to airbnb out closing off availability for others to buy a home or pricing them out of neighborhoods

This is why I am urging everyone to sign this petition which calls for changes in the housing marketing. Special interest rates for first time home buyers, grants that actually help with the purchase of a home, limits to how many homes a single person or entity can own, caps on fees that can be charged on a mortgage.

1mieikn,affordablehousing,"Real Talk: What We’re Seeing With Boxabl Costs, Financing Struggles, and How the Numbers Actually Work","Been working in the prefab and tiny home space helping folks design, permit, and install these types of units — including Boxabl-style homes. I love the vision, and I’m rooting for innovation in housing. But lately, we’ve been running into a lot of *real-world obstacles* that I think more people should know about before jumping in.

This isn’t a takedown post — just sharing insights from the field and hoping to spark a good conversation with others here who’ve looked into prefab.

# 💸 What Buyers Are Actually Paying

Everyone sees the headline — a \~$60K foldable home. But once people start trying to **actually buy, install, and permit** one, the math changes:

* **Boxabl unit cost (realistically):** $60K–$80K depending on upgrades and delivery
* **Foundation + installation:** $10K–$25K
* **Site prep, utilities, tie-ins:** $20K–$40K+
* **Permitting, engineering, local fees:** $5K–$15K

👉 **Total Cost: $110K–$160K**, before land.

This can still be a good deal — but it’s a long way from the sticker price. And most folks aren’t planning on dropping six figures in cash - *for a 360 sq-ft home*.

# 🏦 The Financing Wall

Here’s the #1 issue we’re seeing:

Most lenders **won’t finance** these easily.

* Boxabl units aren’t HUD-certified (yet), so **no manufactured home loans unless they obtain a manufactured home engineer approval** *- similar to what is needed for any mobile home.*
* Conventional lenders often **require permanent foundations + full site install**
* That means you’re often stuck with **construction loans** — higher rates, higher down payments, more paperwork
* Or worse, **no financing option at all** unless your state or county accepts these as full dwellings

We’ve seen folks get stuck mid-process because their lender backs out once they realize how Boxabl is classified. It's a hidden trap.

# 🔀 The Market Is Splitting

What we’re noticing on the ground:

* Wealthy buyers are installing Boxabls as **ADUs or guest suites**
* Lower-income folks (who the product was meant to serve) are being **priced out or denied financing**
* **Large scale**

Unless something shifts — in cost, code classification, or loan access — this could turn into a boutique backyard solution rather than a mass housing revolution.

That said, we’re starting to explore **larger-scale solutions** too. Imagine a fully permitted site with **200+ foldable units**, pre-engineered utilities, community solar, shared infrastructure — a true plug-and-play neighborhood. It’s early, but we’re sketching a prototype in Texas to see what the economics would look like. If Boxabl or others can crack manufacturing efficiency, *this* kind of development could bring the original dream back into reach.

# 🔧 Where It Needs to Go

In my opinion (and from convos with engineers, lenders, and buyers), here’s what will help:

1. Get **total installed cost** closer to $60K or below, for it to be economic on a square footage basis.
2. Partner with **prefab-friendly lenders** to expand financing options

1l8me22,affordablehousing,Affordable Housing/BMR Application,"Like many So Cal residents, I spend a disproportionate amount of my income on rent. In late August 2024 I applied for a housing lottery in the South Bay, however I was not selected during the drawing in early September 2024.

Fast forward to April 25th this year when I received notification that I was selected as a backup winner and that they were requesting my income documents, tax transcripts, and identification. No unit was promised. I was simply advised that they would followup if I came up on their list. I am single with no children so there wasn’t much to fill out. 

On May 29th I received a Tenant Screening Report from Rent Grow with an approval. Shortly thereafter someone from the property called to request updated income and tax information, and emailed me a form from the property’s leasing consultant which had to be hand filled and returned the same day. I ensured that I provided them everything they would need via email and was told that my application was being sent to the city and could take 10-14 days. 

Update on 12 June: Leasing Consultant advised that this can take some time. Follow-up will be provided once a response is received from the city.

Update on 19 June: Leasing Consultant advised corrections were needed on their end. Follow-up will be provided once the city gets back to them again.

Update on 3 July: Followed up with the Leasing Consultant. I have been granted a 650 sq ft unit with all appliances (including washer & dryer)! Earliest move in date is offered is the 9th (likely due to the holiday). Latest move-in offered is 30 days.

Update on 7 July: Visited the property to tour, view my specific unit, sign the lease, and provide both the security deposit and prorated rent. Almost there!

Update on 14 July: I moved in and absolutely love my new place. 

In my experience, 3-6 weeks is normal for the city (LACHA) to review any information and provide an approval/denial. For those wondering the same things, I wish you luck! The process speeds along once City Compliance team clears you.

I’m managing a portfolio of over 6,000 affordable units — mostly Section 8 and LIHTC, with some market-rate sprinkled in. We currently use Yardi, but I’ve been really frustrated with the support we’ve received.

For months, Yardi support told us it wasn’t possible to generate tax credit compliance documents through their system. After some digging on Reddit, I found out it *is* possible — and suddenly they changed their tune and acted like they were subject matter experts all along. That was a few months ago, and we *still* don’t have that functionality fully operational.

Section 8 is figured out when it comes to a fully section 8 building. But if it is a Section 8 and Market then it seems impossible to figure out. It seems like it should all be able to exist in the system seamless because Section 8 and Market works in their own silos. When you combine them that's where the issue arises. 

I’m starting to wonder if there’s a better solution out there. Is there another property management platform that handles affordable housing compliance *well* — ideally with features like auto-populated forms and online signature capabilities?

At the end of the day, if Yardi really is the best option for a portfolio of this size and type, I’ll stick it out. I am just over having projects take longer than I anticipated and being fed misinformation. My goal is to make everything easier for the tenants and people I work with. I am a firm believer in streamlining and modernizing processes.

I’d love to hear what other large-scale affordable housing managers are using, and whether you’ve had better experiences with support, compliance tools, and document workflows.

1kq6kfk,affordablehousing,Affordable housing plan - where to start?,"I'm a plumber in Australia and have always had an interest in affordable housing.  I've had a think in terms of what I could do as far as a small development that may be scalable.  I've now got a rough idea that needs refinement and a whole lot of input from those with more technical knowledge than me.

The basic idea is to create small developments of small houses that are designed to be easily extended over time built on land that is developed in concert with an existing landholder who does not require cash up front.  

These houses are built together as a way to keep labour costs down.  Think as in 2 houses next to each other that only have the same collective footprint and broadly the same materials as a standard 4 bed 2 bath.  The goal would be to negotiate with large materials suppliers for the total cost of the housing to be similar to that of large scale builders.  This saving is then passed on to the buyer.

In terms of the land, I understand this will be one of the trickier aspects.  I believe that finding win win situations is still possible and targeting landholders on the outskirts of towns would be the plan.  The goal is to have the landholder essentially allow for development of their land in return for a completed investment property or 2.  

The most important part is how to pass on these savings and not have them be immediately turned into equity and profit for whoever the buyer is.  Through some (albeit brief) research I think that a restrictive covenant may be the answer.  Essentially a buyer is aware that they are buying a property well under market value and if/when they sell they need to sell at a similar discount.  This may be tied to inflation or wage growth rather than the housing market as a whole.  I believe that the Australian housing market has been artificially inflated for a long time so essentially this is creating another artificial market within it.  

That is the vague thoughts that have been banging around in my head for a while and I was hoping that someone may be able to offer their wisdom or thoughts.  I know I need to have plans for houses and their extensions so a draftsman or architect would need to be involved.  The legalities of the covenant are also unknown to me so some type of legal expert would likewise be needed.  I know it is a broad goal with limited detail but I'd love some input from any that have an interest in the idea.

1icvvw9,affordablehousing,Funding Pause and U.S. Affordable Housing Programs,"Hi All,

Given the funding freeze and uncertainty regarding its applicability, we're hoping to provide some verified info regarding the U.S. Affordable Housing Programs, and any immediate funding implications.  Please feel free to comment regarding any specific affordable housing program and whether or not there's been any official word that the program will or will not continue to be funded.

For my part, I can offer the following:

1. PBRA Funding to owners/agents - HUD's office of Multi-family Housing sent an email on the afternoon of 1/28/25 stating that the PBRA funding will not be affected, and owners can expect payments to continue.  That being said, this morning, systems are... weird.  The signs that upcoming expected payments (to be paid either 2/1 or 2/3) are not there, whereas they normally would be.
2. Tenant Based Rental Assistance - HUD also confirmed that Tenant Based Rental Assistance programs are excluded from the pause.  That being said, I know some PHAs were unable to draw down funds yesterday.

Please post any news you can gather below.

   2.  HUD specifically permitting Safe Harbor income verification for these programs (will state agencies be more inclined to also allow safe harbor for their LIHTC programs if HOME and other programs require that management policies speak to it?)

1k55wj4,affordablehousing,Is Filtering Real?,"On its face, filtering seems like a simple supply and demand graph. Supplying more housing of all types satisfies demand and helps ""self-select"" certain units to specific price points. If Landlord A rents a house for  $1,500/month and a newer/nicer unit is built next door and rented at a similar price, then Landlord A would have to lower their price to meet their new place in the market. 

My heartburn is with the lack of acknowledgement of the builder/owner's financial incentive. Filtering doesn't take into account the owner's financial situation. Landlord B may see that their unit is nicer than $1,500 and rent it at $1,900. Landlord A doesn't necessarily need to lower this price if the units are marketed to different demographics. Additionally, suppose Landlord A has a mortgage that relies heavily on rental income to be repaid. In that case, I'm hesitant to believe they will drop the price and lock themselves into a lease that loses them money.

First of all if the house is 40 years old it should depreciate in value like a car not appreciate in value. I would rather pay more for a brand new well constructed house than pay more for a house that been lived in. People who want to buy houses should only buy if the house is 30% of their income not a penny more. Plus they shouldn’t buy the houses should only if in the end after paying all the interest on it costs more than what the house is worth. This of course depending on where the house is located and what kind of infrastructure has developed in the area. Frankly I think everyone should just not buy a house for two years and force a housing market crash. The people who own all these properties can afford to take a loss. Then property taxes will go down because they have to sell at a lose at least some of them will sell at a loss.

He was surrendered by his owner due to a housing issue (new apartment didn't allow dog's over 40 pound.) He caught a URI(similar to a dog cold) almost immediately after being dropped off at our shelter- which had to be treated until we could make him available for adoption. When he finally beat the cold, he was put on the adoptions floor and stayed there for over 90 days without interest. Patrons stated that he had a ""grumpy face."" He cannot help RBF- can any of us? During these 90 days, we used him for ""dog testing"" in which we test a dog's reactivity/ behavior towards other dogs. He was selected for this testing since he is so mild mannered and gets along with every dog & person. Due to human error, during a dog test, the other dog got loose and bit him aggressively, leaving several SEVERE puncture wounds. He was rushed to urgent veterinary care, and this again resulted in him being taken off of the adoption floor for treatment & recovery time. Through all of this, he REMAINED the most friendly dog towards all people & other dogs. Finally, once he was healthy enough to be put up for adoption, he was taken home and thought he had found his forever family.

Less than 24 hours before Trump threatens to impose a global tariff on a raft of building materials—including lumber—the powerful National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has forecast that 94 million US households (70% of the market) cannot afford an average-priced house ($400,000) based on income thresholds and underwriting standards.

The findings come as part of a housing affordability pyramid published in the 2025 Priced-Out Analysis, revealing the number of households able to purchase a home at various price intervals: “The largest share of households falls within the first step, where homes are priced under $200,000. As home prices increase, fewer and fewer households can afford the next price level, with the highest-priced homes—those over $2 million—having the smallest number of potential buyers.”",502,0.99,199,2025-04-01 10:02:49,ChangeNarrow5633,https://woodcentral.com.au/94-million-households-cant-afford-a-400000-home-in-usa-report/,False,top,4515.0219132552775,0.39641434262948205,0.1111843994657523,0.11041666666666666,0.440625,888,135

It comes after Wood Central reported that tariffs on $3b worth of US-bound Canadian lumber were suspended yesterday afternoon—despite assurances that Trump would eventually impose “a tremendous tariff on lumber”—after lumber prices peaked at a 30-month high on Tuesday.

According to the NAHB, the problem is that the tariffs—now slated to come into effect on April 2—coupled with tariffs already applied to Chinese goods (under 301 and 232 tariffs) and projected hikes to duties on Canadian lumber, will lead to a $3 billion increase in the cost of imported construction materials

We learnt:  
[from a press release about House Bill 538 (passed last year).](https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/HB0538/?ys=2024rs)

[https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsi...538/?ys=2024rs](https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/HB0538/?ys=2024rs)

The main provisions of this bill are:

* Requiring counties to allow the construction of manufactured and modular homes
* For properties that used to be government-owned, are owned by a nonprofit, or are within ¾ mile of a rail station, counties must:
* Allow increased housing density
* Remove limitations on construction (e.g, height restrictions, parking requirements, setbacks, etc.)

Which counties in MD will act to increase affordable home housing supply?

How do we know about MD counties action/plan of these developments?

There was no way to save for the moving cost and down payments etc. BUT. Finally.  We found a rental. A realtor who owns a property.  Its small, but perfect. My kids can stay in their schools, its close to my work. And its less than this motel room!

I inquired about it and thankfully he has a heart and was willing to give me a much needed chance to prove im a good tenant who pays rent on time and im quiet. I dont party. I work, take care of my kids, sleep, then work again. (And im ok with that! My ideal Saturday night is jammies and movies with my babies and a Wednesday sandwhich picnic blowing bubbles etc)

1j0b517,povertyfinance,You should know that Medicaid is named something different in each state.,"Why YSK: a lot of people don't think they're being affected by what's about to happen to Medicaid because they don't believe that they actually have Medicaid. But they do. Here's a quick breakdown of what's going on. The following was written by Ryan DeGooyer:

""I couldn’t figure out why there wasn’t even more outrage about impending Medicaid cuts.. then saw a lady on tv state she wasn’t concerned because she’s on medi-cal… and I realized… some people don’t even know THEIR benefits are being cut because states often rename Medicaid (we all see where this is going right?). 

Medicaid is a joint federal-state program designed to provide healthcare coverage to disabled children and adults. Almost one million senior citizens in nursing homes rely on Medicaid.

**EDIT BY ME, OP: Medicaid is for more than just disabled children and adults. Its for low income ANYONE that meets certain prerequisites.**

The funding structure involves both federal and state contributions, with the federal share determined by the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). 

This percentage varies based on a state's per capita income, ranging from a minimum of 50% to a maximum of 83%. In fiscal year 2022, the federal government covered approximately 69.8% of total Medicaid costs, with states contributing the remaining 30.2%. 
PEWTRUSTS.ORG 

Stop saying ""the state pays medicaid!"" because the state only pays 30-50%. Its FEDERAL money that the states distribute.

Just about everywhere I have looked in the US the cheapest rents are about $1000 a month even before utilities and even checking SpareRoom, Roommates, etc. Most people want a minimum of $1000 to be there roommate or rent a 200 square foot room. People have even given me the suggestion of renting a trailer somewhere. Same thing, every mobile home I have seen starts at around $1000 just for the rent before the lot fees + utilities. 

People tell me to stop looking at NYC or LA or Boston. But I am not. I'm looking at rural and suburban towns in the middle of nowhere. 

Then further more, the rare time a place pops up for $800 or so a month. The landlord wants a minimum income level of around $50K to $60K a year to even be considered. I just can't seem to win.

About 4 years ago, I had a two bad employers that wouldn't pay me and I ended up in a ton of credit card debt. I've spent the last two years paying off all of the debt. Just made my last payment yesterday. 

I'm hoping to save most of my income and maybe find a better job (the market is slow, so it may be awhile). But even then it seems like even people are listing their single wides at $300K that need a lot of work and they are selling! As where true 800 square foot one story homes go for $400K in the middle of nowhere.

I get the fact that people are trying to be helpful. I think most of them are homeowers with combined incomes that have fixed rate mortgages that only cost them $1000 a month. They probably still think rent is $500 a month for a 1 bed room. They are just out of touch.",7139,0.94,1088,2025-04-19 14:05:21,CityonFlameWithRock,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1k32dup/does_anyone_find_it_frustrating_that_most_people/,True,top,4078.9807717544445,0.15240229724050988,1.75019211893205,0.11207983193277311,0.4143907563025209,2068,402
1j8d07p,urbancarliving,I rented my driveway to a car dweller- I didn't have much of a choice,"I am renting my place and pretty sure I am not allowed to rent out my driveway but whatever.  The guy gave me $50 a month since January and I don't drive so it's just his car out there and it's so full of stuff you can't tell there is a person in there.  He comes and goes.  Says he really appreciates having a safe place to park his car and gave me another $50 this month.  I have it in a drawer, lol.  Saving up for him to leave, if he needs it or if I have to tell him to leave because my landlord and all.   I haven't told anyone else about this, a guy living in my driveway.

1jnt385,urbancarliving,I lived in my car for 10 years and I don’t wish it on anyone,"Sure you can save a ton of money …. But it wears on you over time … you couldn’t even tell I was homeless cause I hid it so well 

Showering at the gyms , police harassment while you sleep , i remember one time while I was parked there a group of kids shooting out windows of parked cars ….. after Covid I’m sure it’s almost impossible to use a public restroom unless you buy something …. While I was camping … I got on every low income housing , every section 8 housing list , and was able to get in a program and first I went with a room , then an low income apartment  , 

…. Crazy part is I worked almost 70 hours per week while I was GLAMPING …. 
Noting like sleeping in a nice memory foam mattress and waking up to coffee and a hot shower …… good luck campers ",1787,0.97,203,2025-03-30 22:28:16,bathgate5,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbancarliving/comments/1jnt385/i_lived_in_my_car_for_10_years_and_i_dont_wish_it/,True,top,4550.599922168333,0.11359820928931169,0.39269547544590677,0.16944444444444443,0.6460648148148148,827,172
1juxyqb,urbancarliving,Food from Lady Gaga,"This evening, I was standing outside my suv with a friend talking in one of Las Vegas’ state parks when a man pulled up in a large transit van, stopped and asked us if we would like some food. We said sure and walked around to the sliding door he opened on his vehicle. Inside there were large tin containers you see in big functions or parties. He opened one that had couscous and I was so excited as I haven’t had couscous in a long time. I went back to my car to grab a Tupperware container and the guy opened more of the tins for us which contained fresh green shirazi salads and sun-dried tomato salads. I asked him if he had come by from a big function or wedding off the strip and he said, “No, this is from Lady Gaga”. I was like: “You’re joking”. The man told us he works for her as she is (discreetly) in Vegas tonight for a sound check for her show on Thursday and the food was for her crew. I stood there amazed and we then said: “Thank you so much and please say thank you to Lady Gaga as well for us”. 

(We also told him where there would be other homeless individuals he could go to with the food and he thanks us and left).

So I have read that Lady Gaga is known for being a decent and down to earth person, regardless of her colossal fame and success, but this was a gesture you don’t see very often from people on that level of stardom. At least not in Vegas. I am
Incredibly grateful and just blown away by this kindness. ",1532,0.99,50,2025-04-09 01:01:48,aceswild8,https://i.redd.it/ht3y3zhhrqte1.jpeg,False,top,4332.0410335502775,0.03263707571801567,0.3536439263005932,0.16415343915343916,0.3740244708994709,1463,290
1jc5thc,urbancarliving,I just “met” why car living is seen as bad as the typical street homeless,"I’m in my car at a park where they have a dog park, skate park and a few baseball diamonds along with a typical play set. Sitting in my car waiting for the evening to come to start work(I do door dash) and this couple in an old station wagon pulls up a few hundred feet away. They are  being kind of loud and annoying for about half an hour, but the thing that pisses me off is the lady decides to get up and instead of going to the rest room she decides to just pop a squat right by their vehicle and then they take off. Again keep in minds a children’s play set is very close by.

1k5aqzn,urbancarliving,Tried a storage unit,"I'm back in the car having been here before, thought I'd be clever by renting a 10x20 drive-up unit, perfect amount of space to store my belongings and park my car in there, shut the door and sleep. Access hours were 7 am - 10 pm, perfect for me because I work nights and was looking to escape the coming heat of summer.  

It lasted two weeks, and I felt more cozy and comfortable in there than I had of any living situation over the past four years. Yesterday morning I awoke to a voice, opened my eyes to a cop standing in my unit at my car window, asking me to come out and talk. I got dressed and went out to meet the cop and the property manager. 48 hours to vacate, and I'll get a refund for my two week stay. 

It was worth a shot. I figured I would not be in legal trouble if push came to shove, and I was right. I'll miss the place, and go to plan B - rotating casino parking garages. Thought I'd provide a report for those of us who have been thinking about it",1003,0.98,106,2025-04-22 12:32:32,mrscrillo,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbancarliving/comments/1k5aqzn/tried_a_storage_unit/,True,top,4008.5288117644445,0.10568295114656032,0.2502164876690775,0.26686507936507936,0.5140873015873016,992,200
