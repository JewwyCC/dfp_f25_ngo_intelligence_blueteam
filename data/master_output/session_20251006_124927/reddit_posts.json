I know that this is stressful and there is a lot of fear and confusion about how this will be implemented and what it will actually mean. Because of that it is really important to keep this a **fact based** discussion. Posting unsubstantiated assumptions and speculative rumors is not helpful and only causes more confusion. \n\nIt\u2019s fine to talk about your opinions and feelings, but they need to be clearly framed as *opinions* and *feelings.* Any misinformation or obvious outrage bait will be removed. It\u2019s important to evaluate the trustworthiness of your sources. If it feels like an article is trying to make you feel scared or angry, it may not be the most reliable source. \n\nMost importantly please be civil to each other. You can disagree with someone *without* resorting to personal attacks or name calling. You can hate someone\u2019s opinion but still be respectful towards the person as a human being. Stay on topic and play nice everyone. ",

Maybe having a group chat will help us all get to know each other better and give us more empathy. Additionally with most of us dealing with cold, unpleasant weather for the next few months the group chat will give us a place to socialize and get some real-time human connection. \n\nSo\u2026 at the top of the feed you should see a tab that says **chats.** You can click that and head in to General Homeless Chat to try it out. I plan on adding some fun events, games, or themes too, if you have an idea for something fun to do in the chat send me a message! \n\nRules for the chat are basically the same as in the sub: be respectful, no personal attacks, no begging, no links to other social media platforms or videos, no promotions. People who break the rules can be removed and/or banned from the chat. Have fun!",

    "selftext": "Hey all. I've been homeless for about a month or so now. I live with my younger sister in my SUV in my aunt's front yard. She and her husband let us come in for showers every now and then and to use the bathroom, we can wash our clothes and we can keep small items in her fridge. She's a good couponer, so if she scores a good enough deal on something, she'll give us one of it, and she's made sure to save us each a half of a taco on taco night, so we really could have it a lot worse. We've been in her yard for about 3 weeks give or take, and we have been eaten alive by mosquitoes, but she has neighbors who are cops, and it's meant to be a family friendly neighborhood, so I appreciate being able to keep the windows down at all.\n\n Sleeping in my driver's seat however as we figure out how to arrange my car better has caused me to develop severe bilateral edema, and my feet feel like they're going to burst. My toes often go numb. ER doctor was going to put me on Lasix, but with how many accidents I've had because my aunt wasn't awake and the door was locked, he decided against it. I also have an ear infection, so I can't hear out of my right ear. I was given information for a free medical clinic, but the next day, one of my tires went flat, so I'm coasting on my spare until I get paid. \n\nI had to give up substitute teaching, but I have a job I started last month that I really like and my manager is really understanding and helpful about my situation. I've applied for food stamps to hopefully get us by until I start to get more hours. I'm constantly worried about getting fired though because after about 2 hours, the pain and swelling in my feet is unbearable and I have to take several sit down breaks for the rest of the shift. I try to balance it by coming in early or on days off when they need me. My sister recently got hired for a job down the street from mine, so hopefully things start moving along for us. \n\nI'm very new to being homeless so I appreciate any tips or advice. We are okay on most fronts besides my aunt's husband pushing for a us to not be here and food. Again any advice or tips are appreciated. Thank you. ",

    "selftext": "This would make it harder for homeless people who sleep at rest areas and would make it easier for someone to press charges over panhandling or even loitering. This would impact marginalized people the most, as loitering is already frequently used against minority groups, so police can arrest them for nothing. Here's a source for that from the ACLU https://www.aclu.org/news/criminal-law-reform/if-youre-white-youre-customer-if-youre-black \nIf you live in Michigan, I ask you to please contact them as I did explaining why the rules should not be changed. Here is their website Michigan.gov/ROWRules\nand their email \nMDOT-PublicComments@michigan.gov \nHere is a citation for a Michigan lower court decision that said panhandling is covered under free speech laws https://share.google/8aDFFdU1cM81hI5jb \nHere is the body of the email I already sent them: Peaceful panhandling is legal in Michigan and should remain so, even at rest areas, especially in these hard times. People who stay at rest areas overnight do so because they have no other place to go. By passing these new rules, no one would be addressing those problems; the problems would just be moved somewhere else.\n",

He Happily stays out later with friends (12-1am), whereas with me and around 8pm he will make it VERY clear he wants to go home. \n\nOne saturday I was having an AWFULLY hard night. He offered I stay in the car, I could tell it was a really last minute offer just to be nice, I declined. He said \u201cI\u2019ll put stuff in the car for nights you feel like this\u201d I said ok. Another Saturday (memorial weekends) came around I hinted I reallly didn\u2019t wanna leave the safety and comfort of his car, he said \u201cI just don\u2019t know where to park and unsure about (something else I\u2019m forgetting now)\u201d. I immediately took the hint and said never mind and apologized, he dropped me at my usual park. \n\nLike I said, I\u2019m working 10-13hr days. He doesn\u2019t have a job right now but he\u2019s transferred colleges and is finding a pace. But again.. he\u2019s hanging out with friends just fine. \n\nI understand the age may have a lot more to do with it than I initially realized. I\u2019m just starting to feel like i want more attention from HIM. I get hit on A Lot at the shop I work at, I get free stuff, good tips. And they don\u2019t even know I\u2019m homless!!! \n\nBut I don\u2019t want attention from those people I want it from my significant other that knows I don\u2019t have a bed every night and knows I can\u2019t shower every night and knows how exhausted I am and knows how much ONE HOUR of laying in his car would change my night. But I don\u2019t wanna have to ask for it anymore. I want him to be as eager to help as everyone else seems to be but I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019m expecting too much. \n\n\nI\u2019m debating telling him. But it\u2019s so close to our one year. I found myself crushing on someone I work with, I would NEVER ever ever do anything to compromise my morals or disrespect my SO. But I know even just the simple fact of my small crush is indicative of a larger issue. Any advice would be very very helpful. ",

I heard the worker coming down the aisles and opening up several units for whatever reason. There\u2019s also light sensors so I was able to see the lights cutting on as she moved down the aisles as well. I quickly set up everything and placed some covers and clothes to conceal myself. She gets to my aisle and obviously I don\u2019t have the lock on the outside. I had a few items holding the door down and once she opened the unit I felt myself trembling as I was so nervous I was about to get caught. She called out and asked if anyone was inside but apparently she didn\u2019t actually see me. I also don\u2019t think they are allowed to actually enter the unit. I then heard her lock the unit and stand there for a minute, maybe to write something down. I stayed in this position for another hour until the lights cut off and I was sure she had left. Idk what I\u2019m going to do cause now I\u2019m stuck inside (currently 9pm) until the doors unlock at 6, and the workers come in at 9am. Even if I call them and ask them to remove the lock then I risk being found anyways and potentially kicked out/ trespassed. Not really asking any advice. Just leaving this here for anyone thinking about sleeping in their unit. It\u2019s not worth it.\n\nUPDATE - it is currently 8:16am and I was able to get out through the metal separators at the top of my unit due to a part of it being cut (not by me). I climbed the top of my unit by using my queen sized bed as a sort of ladder. I bent the metal netting in order to fit through and then had to push myself up, I\u2019ll have to fix that but def a problem for another day. I had to use the very little arm strength I have to get myself up. As I sat on top of the netting, with an overview of all the units of my floor, I realized mine was the only one with this escape route on top of my unit so I guess I got extremely lucky in this regard. I was able to jump down from the top of my unit. I\u2019m going to go back at 9:30am to ask them to take the lock off. I am now safe and out of the unit.\n\nAnother update - I went back and they unlocked it for me. They didn\u2019t say a word about if I was in there or not and it was the same lady that almost caught me. Moral of the story, I won\u2019t ever do that again.",

It\u2019s a mental institution, the people here that are being thrown out are not mentally capable of navigating the streets.. and to make matters worse, they gave us the notice on Friday and almost all government social services and homeless services are closed on weekends, so we will be on the streets on Monday morning trying to figure out what to do. The facility I am staying are kicking out 70-80 people. They have different facilities so it will be in the 100\u2019s mentally disabled people being kicked out to the streets in Los Angeles. There is lot of people crying here right now. They have no family or help. They are kicking out people that have no business being on the streets. There is a kid who has half of his brain cut out because of gun violence, he will be out on the streets tomorrow. I gave you the address and I will post a picture so you can see for yourself. We have a caravan of disabled people tomorrow morning heading to skid row. These people will be exposed to drugs and all the crazy stuff that happens in skid row. Please help us \u2026.\n\nCome to the 1450 south St Andrews facility or go to any soul housing locations and see with your eyes mentally disable people being thrown out to the streets with our belongings full of trash bags.

    "selftext": "Don't share that you're homeless at a job.\nI had a regular paying job for a few months, I didn't like the job but it paid for regular food and a room. Then 2 months ago I remember management started to ask me lots of questions about my past. I was reluctant to telling them anything for fear of getting fired. They acted friendly, told me a little about their personal life. Amd that made me feel like it was a safe space. I ended opening up to a manager about being homeless for a while, living on the streets. I thought nothing of it and I felt a little good to just say it to someone else, I'm mostly solitary and have no one to talk to. But I saw something in the manners and behavior change toward me.  A few days later I'm asked to have a meeting with management.  They sat me down, and basically said due to my history I'm no longer a good fit for the job. They took my badge and had me leave immediately.  This was a huge shock to me. I did everything correctly at this job and I never called out sick or showed up late. I asked them what I did wrong, but they said my time with the company is over and to pack my things. As I walked home, 4 miles, I was trying to figure out why they'd do this, why now, what did I do to deserve getting canned so abruptly.  Then it hit me, I told them I was homeless before. That's the only thing that changed. So now I'm worried again on what's going to happen. I have no job, I'm looking and I'm trying. I just wonder why I even said anything at all. \nSo my advice is never tell anyone at all, don't tell anyone you work with in any way. I had a job, now I'm worried about how I'm going to have enough money to eat this week. \nDon't make my mistake plz",

Scammer is counting on luring in older, lonely men who are hoping maybe if they help this girl, they can hook up for sex. Multiple men private message, offering to get her a plane/train/bus ticket to his location and she can be safe staying in his spare room/basement apartment. Scammer pretends to be a na\u00efve girl and is ever so grateful! The men offer to buy the ticket, but no, that won't work bc reasons, girl insists that they send her the funds via an app or whatever so she can buy her own ticket. As soon as they do, the scammer ghosts them. The next day, scammer is back with a new \"18 yo female about to go homeless\" here on Reddit.\n\nEdited to add:  I apologize for wording the above to sound like I somehow think the perverts who are trying to prey on young girls are \"victims\".  I agree with the comments below that they are scum.  I just wanted to post this because it sucks that so many people on this sub waste their precious time typing out helpful paragraphs to the \"girl\", when they could be helping actual houseless folks with advice.",

They are calling it an anti-camping law, but it is really an anti-survival law. It punishes people for not having housing.\n\nIf this law had existed when I was going through it, I could have been ticketed, arrested, or pushed into even more dangerous situations. Instead of getting punished, I got help. I am now housed and stable, but I would not be here if I had not been able to rest safely in my car.\n\nThis law goes into effect on July 1. I am speaking out now because I want others to have the same chance I did. I started a petition to stop it. If you believe that surviving should not be a crime, please sign and share.

He still doesn\u2019t know that I\u2019m homeless and have been for the last 8 months. Today he asked me when did I think I wanted to leave. Not in a way that makes me feel he wants me to go, just asking. I lost my ID before I came here and was hoping to get a new one mailed before I left since I don\u2019t have an address to get the replacement sent back once I get home, he obv doesn\u2019t know that. I told him that as soon as my ID came I\u2019d leave so I didn\u2019t have to deal with the long TSA process. This was the longest time in the last 8 months that I\u2019ve been able to just rest, sleep in an actual bed, and eat home cooked meals everyday. He doesn\u2019t know how much this has been such a relief on my mental health, my body. I\u2019ve been the perfect house gf though so he\u2019s not urging me to go. I cook, clean, give him his space to play his video games, messages, anything he wants cause I appreciate him so much. But I don\u2019t want to overstay my welcome, and everyday I feel bad that I\u2019m basically lying to him. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d love me any less but I\u2019m very ashamed of my situation. I have no clue what I\u2019ll do once I get back to LA but I\u2019m not looking forward to being cold and on the streets again.\n\nUpdate - So I left my bfs about a week ago and I\u2019m back in LA. To answer some questions no I did not tell him yet. Also I asked him if he said it because he wanted me to leave and he actually did not and was pretty upset that I assumed he wanted me to leave. He is currently begging me to come back and just move in with him. Although I\u2019m homeless I feel like it\u2019s too soon to move in together as we\u2019ve only been together for 3 months now. If my situation doesn\u2019t change within the next couple months/ year, and if we\u2019re still together, then I will move in",

    "selftext": "So this happened back in 2015 when I aged out of foster care. \n\nI floated around for awhile with nothing but the clothes on my back, a wool blanket I got from an ambulance & my backpack. Cold & starving I walked to a park & crashed out. \n\nI always hung out at this park because no one ever came around & it was peaceful & safe. \n\nAfter I crashed out for about an hour, something woke me up. Maybe it was a 6th sense, who knows. I started to look around & noticed this guy standing by some picnic tables about 25 yards from me. This guy looked like a skinnier version of Glenn from the show Superstore. He was staring right at me & invited me over for a meal as if he knew I was starving. \n\nSo I reluctantly joined him. I say reluctantly because I was 18 living on the streets for the first time & a lot of people said I looked 14 due to my baby face. Therefore I was extremely cautious around people. The food was really good, it was some type of Pasta dish with bread on the side that he cooked up on the spot with a Coleman stove. \n\nWe talked about a lot of things, mostly my time spent in the foster system. He did at one point ask me if I was religious & I said no. Luckily he left it at that. The whole thing was strange to me. Here's this guy who came out of nowhere, fed me & now I'm opening up to him about my past. Something I have never done, not even in Foster Care. \n\nAfter about an hour, I got up to take a piss behind a tree & grab my backpack. When I looked back over to the table, he was gone. I looked around for him but the nearest parking lot was about 100 yards away. Not even a vehicle was leaving. I then noticed something was left at the table. It was a sleeping bag & a Bible with $200 in it as well as a piece of paper with all the local resources on it. \n\nI'm not sure who this guy was or how he disappeared so quickly but he really did help me. I don't think I would be here today if it wasn't for him. ",

    "selftext": "So I found a job!!! Yay! Money for things, food clothes, phone, etc. It was on a construction project in my town. They are replacing a bridge. I had never done construction before and was really enjoying it. I was learning new skills. How to operate an excavator for example. Its not as hard as I thought it would be. Anyway the superintendent is a vet with severe PTSD. He would periodically start telling us about his time in the army and start crying saying we have to make sure have each brothers back and safety first etc. I really thought he had a good heart and genuinely gave a shit about others. I was wrong!!\n\n He happens to drive by one morning when I was coming out of the woods from my camp about a half mile away and saw me. I got drilled with questions as soon as I arrived. And being the treating dumbest that I am I opened up and told him that I was yes homeless, but that I was saving and would be out of this situation soon because of this job. I thanked him and thought that was the end of it. Again I was wrong. A week later our project gets shut down and the crew gets sent about 2 hrs away to another job. My foreman tells me that I need ti gets ride there. I tried but to no avail. He told me that if I couldn't make it it would be 2 weeks before worked started up again and I would not wait till then. I was unhappy about it but what are you gonna do. \n\nOn the following week on Thursday I get a  text from the super telling me my check was at the office(which is in another state about 1.5 hrs away) and I would need to pick it up. Okay challenging but not impossible. The next day Friday I call the office to ensure someone will be there and I'm told that my check was mailed to my address on file and I was terminated for no call no show. WTF!!!.? So here i am broke, broken and hungry. They owe me about 1000 dollars. That's it!! Just wanted to vent. Don't tell anyone your homeless its just not a good thing.",

The exception would be if you're part of an accredited organization, which this random dude clearly wasn't.\n\nFurthermore, if it isn't something you personally wouldn't eat, you're a jerk if you think a homeless person would like to eat it instead! In the US there is an abundance of food and most unhoused people receive EBT, so very few are actually starving. If they are hungry, they'd be better off eating ramen noodles than something that could harm them. People think it's kind to hand out their old garbage which couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nDitto to grocery stores who donate their 5 day old baked goods and deli items to food pantries. The last thing someone going through Hell needs is to get food poisoning from moldy old ham.\n\nThe way America views unhoused people is appalling. End rant.",

Today I was looking for free food apps and saw that Cinnabon gives you 4 minibons with your first order. I figured out I could just buy a sauce for $0.99 to redeem it, so my total came to $1.30. When I went to pick it up, they handed me a big bag. I repeated my name, and they said, \"yes, this is your order.\" I checked the receipt and it was definitely mine, but when I opened the bag, instead of 4 tiny rolls, it was 4 of the big classic ones. At first I wanted to go back and tell them, but since the sauce I ordered was in there too, I knew it was not someone else\u2019s order, just a mix-up. I felt guilty but decided to keep it. The pack was not heated, so I went to the other Cinnabon in the mall (for some reason there were two) and asked if they could warm them up and put them in separate boxes. The employee was really kind and did it for me.\n\nI ate one and gave the other three to people sitting in the food court who I could tell were also homeless. They did not really look it, but I could tell, and they were thankful. Still, I felt guilty afterward because I know how much some of us try to hide our situation, and by giving them food I felt like I was exposing it. Even though they appreciated it, I could not shake that feeling. I am still not sure if I did the right thing especially since it was only dessert and not a real meal. ",

I\u2019m just scared to do it, I think it has something to do with being in survival mode all the time.\n\nInstead of suicide, let me take myself out gracefully and peacefully.

    "selftext": "For his 21st birthday back in 2019, Jaden Smith, son of famed actor Will Smith, decided to celebrate with the launch of his series of \u2018I Love You\u2019 vegan food trucks that provide free, healthy, and sustainable meals to the homeless community of Skid Row in Los Angeles.\n\nNow, 22-year-old Smith wants to expand his food truck movement to a full-blown vegan restaurant that will continue to give free meals to the unsheltered. If you\u2019re not homeless, don\u2019t worry, you can still eat at Smith\u2019s restaurant, but according to him, \u201cnot only do you have to pay, but you have to pay for more than the food\u2019s worth so that you can pay for the person behind you.\u201d\n\nSmith hasn\u2019t yet revealed when his new restaurant will open nor where it will be located, but he\u2019s instructed his followers to \u201ckeep a lookout.\u201d\n\nOn top of his vegan food truck initiative, Smith and his father own the Just Water company that addresses the contamination of the main water system in Flint, Michigan. He\u2019s also in collaboration with 501CTHREE.org\u2019s Water Box project that provides access to clean water for communities in need.\n\nThe young actor and musician hopes that his two-year-long effort to feed disadvantaged communities will \u201c[give] people what they deserve, healthy vegan food for free.\u201d There is a lot of talk about how the maintenance of a healthy and sustainable life is not as accessible to the underprivileged. Smith\u2019s vegan food trucks work to close this gap by feeding thousands of people in Los Angeles, as well as the unsheltered in Harlem, New York.\n\nhttps://www.optimistdaily.com/2021/05/jaden-smith-expands-free-vegan-food-truck-into-a-restaurant-for-the-homeless/",

I have nothing in common with the people who live, eat and shop at these places. I had to use the restroom in one of the stores, and while I was in there, I wandered around looking at the prices. Cookies: $16, Sandwich: $15. Nothing I can afford for sure. It is the same at the restaurant. Burger: $18. Steak: $35. The apartments are all at least $2200 a month - before all the extra costs and fees. I am to these people what the ant crawling on the ground is to me - something totally alien......living an existence that is almost beyond comprehension. Sometimes the loneliness and isolation weighs me down like something I have to carry. It is exhausting having to live in fear 24/7/365. Why should I be afraid? I haven't done anything wrong.  But living in this society makes me feel like I am an alien who has to remain hidden. ",

I targeted people who looked like they had disposable income. \n\nI found I could make forty or fifty bucks in a matter of hours, and it offered the added bonus of a warm place to hang out. It worked until I mentioned it to a friend, who blew up my spot by going in there every day smelling like a diaper full of shrimp. \n\nI was inspired to share this because I'm sitting at the DMV right now. I'm barely scraping by, but I'd still happily throw someone a fiver if it meant I didn't have to sit here for another half an hour. \n\nETA: It seems to vary by state.

Like being homeless you have to be filthy and falling apart to deserve basic help? Just because I go out of my way to stay clean doesn't mean I'm not struggling! I hand wash my clothes, shower late at night in secluded areas even if it means barely getting any sleep just so I can keep a little bit of dignity! One time I had to ride the train without paying because I needed to get to a soup kitchen. When the fare inspector caught me and asked for my address to write the ticket, I told them I didn't have one and they actually said \"but you smell good???\" Seriously??????? The body spray I have was a freebie from Bath & Body Works because I used to be a a frequent customer back when I had a home and a life! \n\nPlease stop judging people based on appearances!

He laughs and asks me if I was homeless and if so he had connections to get me into housing. I gave him my number and he called a couple of hours later. I met him and this chick who works for the Sherrifs homeless division.\n\nI was given two nights in a hotel and the first night the cop calls me to ask where I was. I was a bit unnerved but I told him. He asked if he could stop by. Nervously I say sure (my fantasy is sleeping with a fine ass cop)\nHe showed up in his uniform looking like a midnight snack and smelling so good. \nMe showered and ready to go until he came in, showed me I had a warrant for my arrest in another county. I was nervous as he gave me a big hug, me looking up at him (Im 5'7 him 6'5) and that's when it felt all wrong. Like I saw his aura and I began to back up and out of his embrace. \nHis aura was obsidian black. Like black black and I knew do not give him my body. \n\nHe caught on and left. I double locked the door and had a difficult time going to sleep. \n\nAfterwards it felt weird seeing him. One day he told me that if I didn't off the streets that he would make my life a living hell. All of a sudden my things are stolen. Four different times. One morning I had gotten violently ill and on the verge of throwing up at the bus stop. I ran to the park bathroom to throw up. I saw him pull him talking rather curt to me. Rolling up his window I ran to the bathroom. \nHe called twice while I was throwing up. I get back to the bus stop and my things were gone from the bus stop. This sorry sack of shit sent my things to the city yard! I called him back and screamed wtf. This bastard saying it's illegal for my things to be where they were (mind you no other cops said anything but him) and I could get my things. \n\nNeedless to say I never got my things back, too expensive at the city yard. \nI about lost my mind. Contemplating suicide. Every time someone asked me where was my wagon with my things I had to hold back tears saying the cop took em away. When I finally said his name, those same people said OH! We know him. He loves harrassing the homeless and a creep to women. \n\nI've been keeping this to myself for the past 6 months. I didnt think any of his supervisors would even care to hear me so I kept quiet. \n\nI feel slightly better now.",

You are generally employed for 3-6 months straight, and they cover your room and food. It may vary from state to state, but I noticed that none of them paid less than 1k a week. \n\nObviously, this job is situational, as you would need somewhere to keep your vehicle long term. Perhaps a friend or family member would let you store your car on their property. \n\nBy the time you got off the ship, you'll definitely have 12-24k saved, and you won't be spending any money on living expenses. This could give you a nice cushion to get on your feet again. \n\nNow I understand there's many different scenarios that could make this job unattainable for someone, but I'm addressing people that this could work for. \n\nAnyways, hope you all have a great new year filled with blessing. Keep your head up and stay safe. ",

    "title": "What's happening, what you should know",
    "selftext": "\n\nHomelessness: The Truth People Don\u2019t Want to Hear\n\nA lot of people have no clue what\u2019s really going on with homelessness. Conservatives keep saying, \u201cThere\u2019s so much housing. There are so many free services. It\u2019s easy for homeless people to get jobs. They just don\u2019t want help, that\u2019s why they suffer.\u201d In a few cases, maybe that\u2019s true. But it\u2019s not that black and white. I\u2019m going to tell you what\u2019s really happening.\n\nJobs and the Reality of Hiring\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about jobs. I\u2019ve volunteered to help homeless people with job searches, and I\u2019ve spoken to career counselors who work with them. It\u2019s not easy. One career counselor told me that out of all the homeless people her company helps with resumes and applications, free of charge, only about 3% actually land a job.\n\nThere\u2019s a saying in the homeless community: \u201cThey want workers, they just don\u2019t want us.\u201d If you have bad teeth, bad skin, a history of drug use, poor hygiene because you live on the street, retail won\u2019t hire you. Why? Because corporations want \u201cpretty\u201d people to stand in front of customers, people they can pay pennies to make shoppers feel good about spending money. Hiring someone who looks like they\u2019ve suffered years on the street doesn\u2019t fit that image.\n\nAdd to this the way modern HR systems work. Automated systems now flag applicants with inconsistent work history, criminal records, or anything that looks \u201crisky.\u201d Back in the 1970s, employers sometimes took chances on people because there was still a sense of loyalty and community. Today, corporations see every employee as a liability. If the algorithm says you\u2019re a risk, you\u2019re automatically screened out. You don\u2019t even get a call back.\n\nI\u2019ve personally known people with college degrees who applied for over 3,000 jobs and never landed a single one.\n\nThe Trap of the System\n\nPeople love to say, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get a job if you just try.\u201d But that\u2019s simply not true, especially today. AI is eliminating jobs, while AI-powered HR software pushes homeless applicants to the bottom of the stack. Even if someone spends hundreds of hours applying, they might never get hired.\n\nMeanwhile, politicians are talking about limiting social services to those who are employed. Imagine that: you\u2019re already suffering, already rejected from every job, and now they want to cut off your healthcare and the few survival programs that exist. If you get injured, you\u2019re left with nothing, no surgery, no disability, no desk job, no insurance, no future. It\u2019s a vicious cycle: you need a job to get healthcare, but you need healthcare to heal so you can work.\n\nThis is the horror of the American system.\n\nPolicing the Homeless\n\nStates briefly backed off chasing the homeless when the population grew too large to control, but now enforcement is back with a vengeance. As housing costs rise and services shrink, populations swell and the crackdown intensifies.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget my own experience. In 2003, I hitchhiked across California. One night, in Red Bluff, I tried to get a ride to Susanville. A man offered me a lift. He realized I wasn\u2019t a drug addict and told me, \u201cI have to get you out of this life before it destroys you.\u201d He was part of a prison gang. Before he could help me, he got into a fight, fled the police, and disappeared.\n\nHis friends, also homeless, let me sleep under a bridge. They didn\u2019t steal from me. They didn\u2019t harm me. But that night, the police swarmed the riverbanks with boats and searchlights, hunting people like animals. These weren\u2019t drug dealers or criminals. Many had jobs. But to the authorities, they were prey.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget how much it felt like a scene from Terminator, the machines sweeping the city, hunting humans in the night. To many homeless people, government authorities feel exactly like that: unthinking robots, following orders, hunting them down.\n\nShelters Are Not a Solution\n\nShelters, we\u2019re told, are the \u201csafe\u201d solution. In reality, they\u2019re often more dangerous than prisons. A study in California found you\u2019re ten times more likely to be sexually assaulted in a homeless shelter than in jail.\n\nWhy? Because shelters are understaffed, overcrowded, and lack security. Multiple beds crammed into one room, no privacy, and predators everywhere. Many homeless people avoid shelters entirely, knowing it\u2019s safer to sleep under a bridge than in a room full of desperate strangers.\n\nIf we wanted shelters to work, they\u2019d have private rooms, private bathrooms, proper screenings, and real staff oversight. Instead, they\u2019ve become holding pens that breed trauma.\n\nFunding, Jails, and the Game of Passing the Buck\n\nHere\u2019s what most Americans don\u2019t know: nobody wants to pay for homelessness. Cities push the burden onto counties, counties push it onto states, and states push it onto the federal government. Everyone plays hot potato with human lives.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason governors support Trump. They think federal \u201csolutions\u201d will take the problem off their budgets. But Trump\u2019s answer isn\u2019t funding shelters or mental health services. His administration is talking about \u201ccamps,\u201d facilities with 12 people per bathroom, no oversight, and conditions worse than prisons. Death camps in everything but name.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t new. After the Civil War, when the South couldn\u2019t legally own slaves anymore, they criminalized poverty. Minor \u201cfelonies\u201d like spitting on the sidewalk turned poor people, mostly freed slaves but also poor whites, into forced labor for the state. It\u2019s estimated 30% of those imprisoned in the post-war South died in these camps. That system of criminalized poverty and modern slavery has never really gone away.\n\nWhere We Stand Now\n\nSo ask yourself: is Trump reviving this system of forced enslavement, just modernized? Is that why governors quietly back him, because they\u2019d rather shift the cost and moral responsibility to the federal government, even if it means camps and death?\n\nWhy don\u2019t we just do the obvious thing: give people jobs, healthcare, and dignity before they\u2019re desperate? Why should someone have to commit a crime to get the same basic services prisons already provide? Why is it easier for an ex-convict to get housing than a struggling, law-abiding citizen?\n\nWe don\u2019t need genocide. We don\u2019t need enslavement. We don\u2019t need a future where America becomes a machine that crushes its own people.\n\nWe can do better. We must do better.",

    "title": "The 10 Commandments of Homelessness",
    "selftext": "Here are the 10 Commandments of Homelessness \u2014 the most critical truths and survival strategies to hold onto when you first find yourself unhoused. This is about staying alive, staying human, and staying smart.\n\nThe 10 Commandments of Homelessness\n\n1. Ditch Your Pride \u2014 Keep Your Dignity\n\nPride will get you hurt, ignored, or passed over for help. You don\u2019t have time for shame. But don\u2019t confuse that with giving up your self-respect. Always carry yourself with dignity, even if you haven\u2019t showered in three days. You\u2019re still you \u2014 no matter where you sleep.\n\n2. Make Safety Your First Religion\n\nYour number one job is to stay safe. Not warm. Not comfortable. Not well-fed. Safe. Scope out every spot before you settle in. Trust your gut. Don\u2019t let exhaustion trick you into taking dumb risks. Where you sleep, who you trust, what you carry \u2014 it all matters.\n\n3. Protect Your ID Like It\u2019s Gold\n\nYour ID is the key to everything: food, shelter, a job, benefits, and eventually getting out. Memorize the number. Make copies if you can. Put it in a Ziploc and keep it close \u2014 even when you sleep. Replace it immediately if it's lost.\n\n4. Learn to Travel Light, Pack Smart\n\nEvery ounce counts. Everything you carry should serve a purpose \u2014 shelter, warmth, food, water, hygiene, documentation, tools. No dead weight. No \u201cjust in case\u201d items. If it doesn\u2019t serve your survival, ditch it.\n\n5. Stay Clean \u2014 As Clean as You Can\n\nHygiene is more than comfort. It\u2019s mental clarity, self-worth, and public perception. Clean socks prevent infection. Baby wipes buy you dignity. A clean look can mean the difference between getting help or being dismissed. Shower when and where you can.\n\n6. Trust Cautiously \u2014 But Find Allies\n\nNot everyone on the street is dangerous, but not everyone is safe either. The rules of trust are different now. Test people before you believe them. But once you find someone who has your back? Keep them close. A good ally can save your life.\n\n7. Eat Every Chance You Get\n\nDon\u2019t turn down food. Don\u2019t assume you\u2019ll find some later. Hunger clouds your thinking, weakens your body, and steals your spirit. Whether it\u2019s a food pantry, a stranger\u2019s kindness, or a church plate \u2014 take it. Store it. Share it if you can.\n\n8. Stay Invisible When You Need To Be\n\nThe less you\u2019re seen, the less you\u2019re targeted. Blend in when you must. Move with intention. Don\u2019t loiter where you sleep. Don\u2019t make enemies where you eat. Watch the quiet ones \u2014 they\u2019ve usually been out here the longest for a reason.\n\n9. Learn the System, Then Use It\n\nGet familiar with local shelters, food banks, hygiene stations, and churches. Know who does what and what time. Learn what documents you need for housing apps or job help. Take free classes. Use public libraries. Use everything. You're not a burden \u2014 you're a human being trying to survive a rigged system.\n\n10. Don\u2019t Let the Street Rewrite You\n\nYou may live outside, but you are not less than. You are not garbage. You are not disposable. This system wants you to believe you\u2019re the problem \u2014 you\u2019re not. Keep your heart, your humor, your humanity. This world is broken, not you.\n\n\n",

On June 5th they reached out , after countless voicemails and emails from me regarding an update, and told me my application was still processing and my move-in date would no longer be valid. The manager, rarely returns calls or emails and it feels like i'm harassing them for an update every time I call. Mind you I have already paid a portion of my deposit and signed paperwork. I contacted the city of irvine , OSHA as well as fair housing council; all have been a dead end and the city no longer returns my calls. Is anyone else experiencing this with them ?

The builder had committed to hand over possession of the flats by January 2023, but till date only around 70% of the work has been completed.\n\nThis project is registered under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Affordable Housing Scheme), yet the beneficiaries are suffering badly due to the inaction and negligence of the builder. Despite repeated follow-ups, no concrete timeline has been provided for possession.\n\nIt is extremely disheartening that DTCP and RERA officials appear to be favouring the builder, while the common man continues to suffer. The buyers are under tremendous financial pressure as they are simultaneously paying EMIs on bank loans, house rent, and children\u2019s school fees.\n\nWe therefore request you to kindly:\n\n1. Take strict action against the builder for non-compliance with possession timelines.\n\n\n2. Impose penalties as per RERA guidelines.\n\n\n3. Ensure a clear and time-bound schedule for completion and possession.\n\n\n4. Safeguard the interests of buyers under the Affordable Housing Scheme.\n\n\n\nWe hope that the administration will take our grievance seriously and provide us timely justice.\n\nYours sincerely,\nBikram singh \n\n",

The Canadian side boomed with tourism while the U.S. side withered.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: the bones are still here.\n- Homes selling for $40k - $90k, sometimes less\n- Classic brick duplexes and small single-families with solid structure\n- Access to cheap hydropower (some of the lowest electric rates in the country)\n- Walkability around downtown if it were cared for\n- Proximity to Buffalo\u2019s resurgence, the border, and natural beauty like the gorge and the Falls themselves\n\nWhat\u2019s missing? People who actually want to live here and build community. Right now, most tourists drive in, see the Falls, and leave. Locals have fled. It\u2019s a hollowed-out city with real potential but no critical mass.\n\nImagine:\n- Affordable live-work spaces for artists, makers, and remote workers priced out of big cities\n- Rehabbed duplexes rented to young families who want stability\n- A new culture of small cafes, breweries, and galleries along the riverfront\n- Energy-intensive startups (data centers, indoor farming, battery recycling) powered by cheap hydro\n\nChallenges. You\u2019d be dealing with poverty, disinvestment, city politics, and perception. But the upside is strong for those willing to be early. Buffalo is already seeing a comeback.

    "selftext": "Some people have said to me \"I was able to buy my home cheaper than that. You can too.\"\nBut not everyone's reality is the same for everyone else. Yes, there are new home communities you can get into at a high cost and sometimes you have to leave your target area, and if you make a large down payment, sure! Your mortgage cost will be cheaper. \n\nBut the reality is, this is not an option for everyone. \n\nThere are MANY young people struggling out here for affordable housing. Rent is too high. Kids are living with their parents well into their 20s because they can't afford to be out on their own. Cost of living in general is too high (groceries, gas, insurance, clothes, cars). But it starts with cost of housing. \n\nIn 1985, the median U.S. home price was around $82,000 (\u22483x the median household income).\n\nIn 2025, the median home price is around $420,000+ (\u22486\u20138x median income).\n\nThis makes buying a first home much harder for millennials than it was for Boomers or even early Gen X\n\nMillennials are also marrying and having children later or sometimes not at all, because they can\u2019t afford homes, childcare (often >$1,200/month), or medical bills for pregnancy\n\nAnother issue is people and companies buying up multiple houses to rent at high costs or to airbnb out closing off availability for others to buy a home or pricing them out of neighborhoods\n\nThis is why I am urging everyone to sign this petition which calls for changes in the housing marketing. Special interest rates for first time home buyers, grants that actually help with the purchase of a home, limits to how many homes a single person or entity can own, caps on fees that can be charged on a mortgage.\n\nPlease sign my petition \ud83d\udc49 https://chng.it/nxGs9j2vqk",

    "selftext": "Been working in the prefab and tiny home space helping folks design, permit, and install these types of units \u2014 including Boxabl-style homes. I love the vision, and I\u2019m rooting for innovation in housing. But lately, we\u2019ve been running into a lot of *real-world obstacles* that I think more people should know about before jumping in.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a takedown post \u2014 just sharing insights from the field and hoping to spark a good conversation with others here who\u2019ve looked into prefab.\n\n# \ud83d\udcb8 What Buyers Are Actually Paying\n\nEveryone sees the headline \u2014 a \\~$60K foldable home. But once people start trying to **actually buy, install, and permit** one, the math changes:\n\n* **Boxabl unit cost (realistically):** $60K\u2013$80K depending on upgrades and delivery\n* **Foundation + installation:** $10K\u2013$25K\n* **Site prep, utilities, tie-ins:** $20K\u2013$40K+\n* **Permitting, engineering, local fees:** $5K\u2013$15K\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Total Cost: $110K\u2013$160K**, before land.\n\nThis can still be a good deal \u2014 but it\u2019s a long way from the sticker price. And most folks aren\u2019t planning on dropping six figures in cash - *for a 360 sq-ft home*.\n\n# \ud83c\udfe6 The Financing Wall\n\nHere\u2019s the #1 issue we\u2019re seeing:\n\nMost lenders **won\u2019t finance** these easily.\n\n* Boxabl units aren\u2019t HUD-certified (yet), so **no manufactured home loans unless they obtain a manufactured home engineer approval** *- similar to what is needed for any mobile home.*\n* Conventional lenders often **require permanent foundations + full site install**\n* That means you\u2019re often stuck with **construction loans** \u2014 higher rates, higher down payments, more paperwork\n* Or worse, **no financing option at all** unless your state or county accepts these as full dwellings\n\nWe\u2019ve seen folks get stuck mid-process because their lender backs out once they realize how Boxabl is classified. It's a hidden trap.\n\n# \ud83d\udd00 The Market Is Splitting\n\nWhat we\u2019re noticing on the ground:\n\n* Wealthy buyers are installing Boxabls as **ADUs or guest suites**\n* Lower-income folks (who the product was meant to serve) are being **priced out or denied financing**\n* **Large scale**\n\nUnless something shifts \u2014 in cost, code classification, or loan access \u2014 this could turn into a boutique backyard solution rather than a mass housing revolution.\n\nThat said, we\u2019re starting to explore **larger-scale solutions** too. Imagine a fully permitted site with **200+ foldable units**, pre-engineered utilities, community solar, shared infrastructure \u2014 a true plug-and-play neighborhood. It\u2019s early, but we\u2019re sketching a prototype in Texas to see what the economics would look like. If Boxabl or others can crack manufacturing efficiency, *this* kind of development could bring the original dream back into reach.\n\n# \ud83d\udd27 Where It Needs to Go\n\nIn my opinion (and from convos with engineers, lenders, and buyers), here\u2019s what will help:\n\n1. Get **total installed cost** closer to $60K or below, for it to be economic on a square footage basis.\n2. Partner with **prefab-friendly lenders** to expand financing options\n3. Build **state-by-state install playbooks** to handle code, zoning, and inspection differences\n4. Standardize and simplify the **foundation + utility hookup process**\n\n# \ud83d\udca1 Want to Share What You're Seeing?\n\nIf you\u2019ve tried to get a Boxabl unit, or priced it out, or spoken to lenders \u2014 what did you run into? Is anyone here actually living in one?\n\nI\u2019d love to learn from others going through the real process and share resources. It\u2019s still early, but we\u2019re all trying to make smarter housing a reality.\n\n# \ud83d\udd17 Bonus if You\u2019re Dealing with Install Headaches\n\nWe've been helping a few folks simplify their site prep and foundations with pre-designed economic foundation plans & services for Boxabl-style units. If you\u2019re trying to get one permitted, you can check out [BoxablFoundations.com](https://boxablfoundations.com/). Not trying to spam \u2014 just sharing what\u2019s helped clients navigate the red tape.",

In late August 2024 I applied for a housing lottery in the South Bay, however I was not selected during the drawing in early September 2024.\n\nFast forward to April 25th this year when I received notification that I was selected as a backup winner and that they were requesting my income documents, tax transcripts, and identification. No unit was promised. I was simply advised that they would followup if I came up on their list. I am single with no children so there wasn\u2019t much to fill out. \n\nOn May 29th I received a Tenant Screening Report from Rent Grow with an approval. Shortly thereafter someone from the property called to request updated income and tax information, and emailed me a form from the property\u2019s leasing consultant which had to be hand filled and returned the same day. I ensured that I provided them everything they would need via email and was told that my application was being sent to the city and could take 10-14 days. \n\nUpdate on 12 June: Leasing Consultant advised that this can take some time. Follow-up will be provided once a response is received from the city.\n\nUpdate on 19 June: Leasing Consultant advised corrections were needed on their end. Follow-up will be provided once the city gets back to them again.\n\nUpdate on 3 July: Followed up with the Leasing Consultant. I have been granted a 650 sq ft unit with all appliances (including washer & dryer)! Earliest move in date is offered is the 9th (likely due to the holiday). Latest move-in offered is 30 days.\n\nUpdate on 7 July: Visited the property to tour, view my specific unit, sign the lease, and provide both the security deposit and prorated rent. Almost there!\n\nUpdate on 14 July: I moved in and absolutely love my new place. \n\nIn my experience, 3-6 weeks is normal for the city (LACHA) to review any information and provide an approval/denial. For those wondering the same things, I wish you luck! The process speeds along once City Compliance team clears you. ",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI\u2019m managing a portfolio of over 6,000 affordable units \u2014 mostly Section 8 and LIHTC, with some market-rate sprinkled in. We currently use Yardi, but I\u2019ve been really frustrated with the support we\u2019ve received.\n\nFor months, Yardi support told us it wasn\u2019t possible to generate tax credit compliance documents through their system. After some digging on Reddit, I found out it *is* possible \u2014 and suddenly they changed their tune and acted like they were subject matter experts all along. That was a few months ago, and we *still* don\u2019t have that functionality fully operational.\n\nSection 8 is figured out when it comes to a fully section 8 building. But if it is a Section 8 and Market then it seems impossible to figure out. It seems like it should all be able to exist in the system seamless because Section 8 and Market works in their own silos. When you combine them that's where the issue arises. \n\nI\u2019m starting to wonder if there\u2019s a better solution out there. Is there another property management platform that handles affordable housing compliance *well* \u2014 ideally with features like auto-populated forms and online signature capabilities?\n\nAt the end of the day, if Yardi really is the best option for a portfolio of this size and type, I\u2019ll stick it out. I am just over having projects take longer than I anticipated and being fed misinformation. My goal is to make everything easier for the tenants and people I work with. I am a firm believer in streamlining and modernizing processes.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear what other large-scale affordable housing managers are using, and whether you\u2019ve had better experiences with support, compliance tools, and document workflows.\n\nAppreciate any recommendations or insight. Thanks!",

Our combined total income is a little over 41k, but for two people, this listing says \"60% Income Limit\" for 39780.00. I included the chart so y'all can see what they're saying.\n\nI'm just stuck on what this even means. If they're saying we're making too much to qualify for affordable housing, that's total BS first off. But what I *think* it's saying is that if 60% of your total combined income is above this amount you can't move in, so if this is close to 100% of our income, it'd be fine, right? I'm just really hung up on how they're phrasing it, so I was hoping that someone here may have experience with affordable housing options that have this restriction and could offer insight or clarification.

    "selftext": "I'm a plumber in Australia and have always had an interest in affordable housing.  I've had a think in terms of what I could do as far as a small development that may be scalable.  I've now got a rough idea that needs refinement and a whole lot of input from those with more technical knowledge than me.\n\nThe basic idea is to create small developments of small houses that are designed to be easily extended over time built on land that is developed in concert with an existing landholder who does not require cash up front.  \n\nThese houses are built together as a way to keep labour costs down.  Think as in 2 houses next to each other that only have the same collective footprint and broadly the same materials as a standard 4 bed 2 bath.  The goal would be to negotiate with large materials suppliers for the total cost of the housing to be similar to that of large scale builders.  This saving is then passed on to the buyer.\n\nIn terms of the land, I understand this will be one of the trickier aspects.  I believe that finding win win situations is still possible and targeting landholders on the outskirts of towns would be the plan.  The goal is to have the landholder essentially allow for development of their land in return for a completed investment property or 2.  \n\nThe most important part is how to pass on these savings and not have them be immediately turned into equity and profit for whoever the buyer is.  Through some (albeit brief) research I think that a restrictive covenant may be the answer.  Essentially a buyer is aware that they are buying a property well under market value and if/when they sell they need to sell at a similar discount.  This may be tied to inflation or wage growth rather than the housing market as a whole.  I believe that the Australian housing market has been artificially inflated for a long time so essentially this is creating another artificial market within it.  \n\nThat is the vague thoughts that have been banging around in my head for a while and I was hoping that someone may be able to offer their wisdom or thoughts.  I know I need to have plans for houses and their extensions so a draftsman or architect would need to be involved.  The legalities of the covenant are also unknown to me so some type of legal expert would likewise be needed.  I know it is a broad goal with limited detail but I'd love some input from any that have an interest in the idea.       ",

Please feel free to comment regarding any specific affordable housing program and whether or not there's been any official word that the program will or will not continue to be funded.\n\nFor my part, I can offer the following:\n\n1. PBRA Funding to owners/agents - HUD's office of Multi-family Housing sent an email on the afternoon of 1/28/25 stating that the PBRA funding will not be affected, and owners can expect payments to continue.  That being said, this morning, systems are... weird.  The signs that upcoming expected payments (to be paid either 2/1 or 2/3) are not there, whereas they normally would be.\n2. Tenant Based Rental Assistance - HUD also confirmed that Tenant Based Rental Assistance programs are excluded from the pause.  That being said, I know some PHAs were unable to draw down funds yesterday.\n\nPlease post any news you can gather below.\n\n  \nEDIT (Adding some links):\n\n* NAHRO's article providing tidbits (updated as info becomes available):  [https://www.nahro.org/news/omb-pauses-federal-financial-assistance/](https://www.nahro.org/news/omb-pauses-federal-financial-assistance/)\n* Statement from NLIHC:  [https://nlihc.org/news/nlihc-statement-trump-administrations-decision-freeze-federal-grants-and-loans](https://nlihc.org/news/nlihc-statement-trump-administrations-decision-freeze-federal-grants-and-loans)",

Only to get a phone call the very next day saying that they were sorry, the voucher wasn't going to go through because the government put a freeze on it and they weren't sure when they were going to be approved to release funding. I keep seeing news articles saying there was a temporary ban, then it was lifted. Now there's articles saying that its still frozen and some cities are claiming theirs is unfrozen?

Supplying more housing of all types satisfies demand and helps \"self-select\" certain units to specific price points. If Landlord A rents a house for  $1,500/month and a newer/nicer unit is built next door and rented at a similar price, then Landlord A would have to lower their price to meet their new place in the market. \n\nMy heartburn is with the lack of acknowledgement of the builder/owner's financial incentive. Filtering doesn't take into account the owner's financial situation. Landlord B may see that their unit is nicer than $1,500 and rent it at $1,900. Landlord A doesn't necessarily need to lower this price if the units are marketed to different demographics. Additionally, suppose Landlord A has a mortgage that relies heavily on rental income to be repaid. In that case, I'm hesitant to believe they will drop the price and lock themselves into a lease that loses them money. ",

As part of my research, I\u2019ve created a survey and would really appreciate any responses. Your input will help provide valuable insights\u2014thank you in advance!\n\n**Survey Motivations:**\u00a0We know a lot about organized tenant movements and their strategies, but much less about the individual actions tenants take in response to difficult rental situations. Not everyone is able or willing to participate in formal movements, yet their experiences and efforts are still part of the larger fight for housing justice.  \n  \nThis study seeks to explore the motivations and themes behind everyday tenant activism. It does not aim to identify specific tactics that could inform landlords but rather to highlight the struggles renters face and the actions they take to navigate them. All answers will remain anonymous and no identifiable characteristics are requested.\u00a0\n\nSurvey: [https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_02H5bV1pvJa0Q9U](https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_02H5bV1pvJa0Q9U)",

First of all if the house is 40 years old it should depreciate in value like a car not appreciate in value. I would rather pay more for a brand new well constructed house than pay more for a house that been lived in. People who want to buy houses should only buy if the house is 30% of their income not a penny more. Plus they shouldn\u2019t buy the houses should only if in the end after paying all the interest on it costs more than what the house is worth. This of course depending on where the house is located and what kind of infrastructure has developed in the area. Frankly I think everyone should just not buy a house for two years and force a housing market crash. The people who own all these properties can afford to take a loss. Then property taxes will go down because they have to sell at a lose at least some of them will sell at a loss. Otherwise houses are going to cost so much that a person making $100,000 a year with no kids won\u2019t be able to afford a home. Stop being suckers and paying more than what these houses are really worth. ",

He was surrendered by his owner due to a housing issue (new apartment didn't allow dog's over 40 pound.) He caught a URI(similar to a dog cold) almost immediately after being dropped off at our shelter- which had to be treated until we could make him available for adoption. When he finally beat the cold, he was put on the adoptions floor and stayed there for over 90 days without interest. Patrons stated that he had a \"grumpy face.\" He cannot help RBF- can any of us? During these 90 days, we used him for \"dog testing\" in which we test a dog's reactivity/ behavior towards other dogs. He was selected for this testing since he is so mild mannered and gets along with every dog & person. Due to human error, during a dog test, the other dog got loose and bit him aggressively, leaving several SEVERE puncture wounds. He was rushed to urgent veterinary care, and this again resulted in him being taken off of the adoption floor for treatment & recovery time. Through all of this, he REMAINED the most friendly dog towards all people & other dogs. Finally, once he was healthy enough to be put up for adoption, he was taken home and thought he had found his forever family. Unfortunately, after only being there for 11 days, he pooped on the front porch. The family decided- after this one incidence- that he was not house-trained, and they returned him to the shelter. This is a desperate plea- this baby deserves better. Due to his \"history\" and length of time spent in shelter, he will be euthanized. He does not deserve this. If I had any capability to take hi myself, I WOULD. I am posting this in a desperate final attempt that someone may read this and be able to provide the life that he deserves. I know I can personally relate to being dealt a shitty hand in life, but it seems even worse when it is at the hands of an undeserving animal- I hope this speaks to someone else <3 and if it does, you won't regret taking this beautiful soul into your life & home",

That is according to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), which surveyed US builders earlier this month.\n\nThe survey shows that, on average, 64.4% of the sales price is due to construction costs and 13.7% to finished lot costs, with the builder\u2019s margin remaining stable at 11.0% of the sales price. At the same time, the average size of a single-family home is 2,647 square feet\u2014an increase of 86 square feet from 2022 but still far below the average in years surveyed prior to 2022.",

I DONT regret her. \n\nBut I really take issue with that comment when people try to dissuade you from having an abortion. \n\nIt's SO unfair to the child(ren) if you can't afford basic necessities and even then some. And I'm calling myself out. \n\nThe first few months, I could barely afford to feed myself. I'd have to skip meals to buy the rest of the formula my daughter needed (WIC covered most of it, but not all), because my tits decided not to work. I could not afford all the time I took off for her doctors appointments, nor her constantly outgrowing clothes. I did it, but it was extremely hard and almost impossible \n\nNow that it's winter, she's needed hats, mittens, leggings, jackets, and other expensive clothes. I've bought them as I can, and I still haven't been able to buy her hats, but I'm trying.\n\nThe alternative is to not buy her those things and just layer her in the summer clothes she had that was her size now. But her head would be cold, her hands would be cold. She wouldn't have appropriate winter shoes. \n\nAnd of course, all the people who pressured me to keep her were nowhere to help when I needed it. But they sure loved to tell me I could \"make it work\". \n\nI'm slowly figuring out my financial situation, but do NOT listen to people who tell you this if you're on the fence. Make your own informed decision. Do not let yourself get guilt tripped. ",

    "selftext": "Why YSK: a lot of people don't think they're being affected by what's about to happen to Medicaid because they don't believe that they actually have Medicaid. But they do. Here's a quick breakdown of what's going on. The following was written by Ryan DeGooyer:\n\n\"I couldn\u2019t figure out why there wasn\u2019t even more outrage about impending Medicaid cuts.. then saw a lady on tv state she wasn\u2019t concerned because she\u2019s on medi-cal\u2026 and I realized\u2026 some people don\u2019t even know THEIR benefits are being cut because states often rename Medicaid (we all see where this is going right?). \n\nMedicaid is a joint federal-state program designed to provide healthcare coverage to disabled children and adults. Almost one million senior citizens in nursing homes rely on Medicaid.\n\n**EDIT BY ME, OP: Medicaid is for more than just disabled children and adults. Its for low income ANYONE that meets certain prerequisites.**\n\nThe funding structure involves both federal and state contributions, with the federal share determined by the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). \n\nThis percentage varies based on a state's per capita income, ranging from a minimum of 50% to a maximum of 83%. In fiscal year 2022, the federal government covered approximately 69.8% of total Medicaid costs, with states contributing the remaining 30.2%. \nPEWTRUSTS.ORG \n\nStop saying \"the state pays medicaid!\" because the state only pays 30-50%. Its FEDERAL money that the states distribute. \n\nSo, If you or your loved ones are covered by any of the following\u2026 they are talking about you:\n\nObamacare is Medicaid\n\nAlabama: Medicaid  \nAlaska : DenaliCare  \nArizona: Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS)  \nArkansas: Arkansas Health and Opportunity for Me (ARHOME)  \nCalifornia: Medi-Cal  \nColorado: Health First Colorado  \nConnecticut: HuskyHealth, Husky C (for aged, blind or disabled persons)  \nDelaware: Diamond State Health Plan (Plus)  \nFlorida: Statewide Medicaid Managed Care Program (SMMC), Managed Medical Assistance (MMA) Program, Long-term Care (LTC) Program  \nGeorgia: PeachState  \nHawaii : MedQuest  \nIdaho: Medicaid  \nIllinois: Medical Assistance Program, AllKids, FamilyCare  \nIndiana: Hoosier Healthwise, Hoosier Care Connect, M.E.D.

However, I only make $42K a year before tax. \n\nA lot of people tell me, if you are unhappy where you are living, \"MOVE!\" but I literally can't afford rent anywhere in the country. Not even in the middle of nowhere Iowa or Nebraska or Wyoming. \n\nJust about everywhere I have looked in the US the cheapest rents are about $1000 a month even before utilities and even checking SpareRoom, Roommates, etc. Most people want a minimum of $1000 to be there roommate or rent a 200 square foot room. People have even given me the suggestion of renting a trailer somewhere. Same thing, every mobile home I have seen starts at around $1000 just for the rent before the lot fees + utilities. \n\nPeople tell me to stop looking at NYC or LA or Boston. But I am not. I'm looking at rural and suburban towns in the middle of nowhere. \n\nThen further more, the rare time a place pops up for $800 or so a month. The landlord wants a minimum income level of around $50K to $60K a year to even be considered. I just can't seem to win.\n\nAbout 4 years ago, I had a two bad employers that wouldn't pay me and I ended up in a ton of credit card debt. I've spent the last two years paying off all of the debt. Just made my last payment yesterday. \n\nI'm hoping to save most of my income and maybe find a better job (the market is slow, so it may be awhile). But even then it seems like even people are listing their single wides at $300K that need a lot of work and they are selling! As where true 800 square foot one story homes go for $400K in the middle of nowhere.\n\nI get the fact that people are trying to be helpful. I think most of them are homeowers with combined incomes that have fixed rate mortgages that only cost them $1000 a month. They probably still think rent is $500 a month for a 1 bed room. They are just out of touch.",

I went back to my car to grab a Tupperware container and the guy opened more of the tins for us which contained fresh green shirazi salads and sun-dried tomato salads.

The man told us he works for her as she is (discreetly) in Vegas tonight for a sound check for her show on Thursday and the food was for her crew.
