1nxmrqq,povertyfinance,"Need Help Finding Affordable Housing for My 78-Year-Old Father ‚Äî $1,750/month Social Security Income with no assets / no ability to work (Los Angeles area)","Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm reaching out for advice on behalf of my 78-year-old father. He‚Äôs currently homeless and staying in a 50 square foot pool room in my mom's backyard. She actually has been divorced from him for 20 years and wanted to fully move on from him, but ended up offering this to him because the alternative would be him living in his car - He's been living there for 4 weeks, and she set a deadline for him of 2 weeks to be out. I‚Äôm trying to find any ideas as to how to help him. We are in Los Angeles (more specifically, the San Fernando Valley).

A quick breakdown of his situation:

* Income: $1,750/month from Social Security
* Assets: An older car that is paid off. Otherwise - no home, no savings
* Health: Not in great shape ‚Äî Diabetic, broke his hip 9 months ago, but has recovered somewhat and can walk, drive, etc. He has to pee often (wears a diaper), and is somewhat physically limited. Medicare / Medicaid cover all health / dental though.
* Given his health and difficulty with using technology / computers, I don't believe he would be able to work. He expressed interest in being a Walmart greeter. I don't believe this will work, but won't cross it off just yet.

I'm honestly not even really sure about where to even start looking for affordable housing. We applied to many section 8 rentals, but our understanding is that there are thousands applying to each of these, and that some people have to wait years to get accepted. I'm currently renting a room, and have my own debt to work down - I checked with my landlord, and they would not allow him to live in the house, even if it was in my own room. My two siblings are doing better than me financially, but sadly don't have a great relationship with him, and will not do much to help, other than maybe a small amount per month ($100-200, and even that would not be a sure thing).

Given the fact that it could take years to get accepted, the paying 30% of your income for rent for Section 8 option is a fantasy right now. Studio apartments and shared housing (i.e. renting out a room) are really the only things we're looking at, and even that would require each child to contribute a set amount per month to help. He also has significant debt and a terrible credit score, which makes apt applications difficult. We thought about LCOL states and even countries, but having him far away would mean no one there to help him, and he is opposed to it just because he doesn't want to leave our area, and is quite stubborn. One compromise we thought about is perhaps the desert region (i.e. Lancaster, Palmdale, Acton, etc.) which is 1.5 hours away, and generally cheaper. I don't believe he wants to move there, either, but we are trying to convince him to keep all his options open.

Another option that bypasses the credit score issue is to buy an RV or trailer (i.e. non-driving RV). The challenges here would be having to pay a large lump sum upfront for an RV / trailer, having to deal with parking, dealing with going to dump stations to empty septic tank, etc. No rent, but more complex and more to do for someone of his capabilities and age. Not as easy as living in a home or apartment. 

The last option is him living in his car - This is something that he said will do if he has to, but I don't think he realizes just how hard it will be because of his condition and age, but also because he's never even done it before, and just doesn't realize the challenges. To be honest, I don't even want to list this as a realistic option, even though he said he's willing to do it.

Overall, this is a big challenge and there aren't a ton of great options, but we're trying to find the most realistic ones. Any direction, experience, or even just encouragement would be hugely appreciated.",55,0.92,73,2025-10-04 02:37:46,ComprehensiveKiwi489,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1nxmrqq/need_help_finding_affordable_housing_for_my/,True,search,86.46419832916666,1.3272727272727274,0.6361014276754943,0.15961689600082457,0.5180590986394558,3922,725

1ntlv8m,povertyfinance,I sent one email and saved $75 a month on rent,"
I always thought rent was just a fixed thing. The number on the renewal notice comes in the mail and that‚Äôs it. For years I just signed and felt kinda stuck. My rent went up little by little and I never questioned it because I figured ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just how it works.‚Äù

This year I finally tried something different. I was nervous as hell about it, but I sat down and wrote a simple email to my landlord. Nothing fancy, just polite and straight to the point. I mentioned that I liked living here, that I saw similar places nearby renting for less, and asked if they‚Äôd consider adjusting my rent down a bit if I renewed early. I honestly thought they‚Äôd laugh or ignore me.

Two days later I got a reply and they agreed to knock $75 off a month. That‚Äôs $900 a year. For me that‚Äôs a huge deal because it‚Äôs money I can actually put towards groceries and savings instead of just watching it disappear. The wild part is how easy it was. I didn‚Äôt have to argue or make threats. Just sending a respectful message and having some proof of other rents was enough.

What I learned is that landlords kind of expect tenants not to ask. If you don‚Äôt say anything, they just keep raising rent and you eat the cost. But if you do speak up, sometimes they‚Äôll budge because keeping a tenant is less hassle than finding a new one.

1ny9kj0,homeless,Do you think it's rosy colored for someone who has experienced homelessness before to fall into it again?,"I will expand my title in the body text.

I grew up going from place to place, not having a childhood home, but always remaining sheltered. My family dealt with housing insecurity. My father was aloof and depressed, and my mother had untreated PTSD. It's relevant because the household was dysfunctional in that there was physical beatings, denial of food and shelter, and harsh (putting it mildly) words being thrown often from young, like 8 years old young. We've lived in hotels for longer than 3 days (think 4 months, 1.5 month), so that's where the homeless classification comes from. They were all I had, as I grew up socially isolated, but the toxicity became too much. I am NC with them. It was that bad. 

Recently, I became homeless by myself, and I was in a shelter for five months then placed on a temporary program that offers rental assistance for 24 months. It ends next year. The program is the only reason I can afford this place because the job I have now doesn't come close to paying rent, let alone the other things that must be paid in order to not be evicted, and this job is the best my city has to offer for someone in my position. Other jobs pay even lower and are part time (they've rejected me so it's not like I can go. I deal with name discrimination and from how I grew up, I struggle with social conventions and have bad social anxiety, so passing interviews is a difficult task for me.).

Right now, I've been struggling with my job because of hostility from one of my coworkers. Many of my coworkers are rather hostile, but one blew up at me by verbally accosting me for something she believed wasnt true (and part of it was allowing her boyfriend coworker to do her assigned job but his facing difficulty because our supervisor locked a bathroom he didnt have a key to, never asked me to opened, and didnt realize she had a key to the door as well). I do my work, stay to myself, and go home (like my supervisor suggests for everyone) but it wasnt enough for my coworkers because theyre usually forcing me to talk, commenting how rude I am for not talking, and being hostile toward me by calling me crazy. Im dealing with my mental health from how I was raised. That incident with the coworker reminded me of the way my own mother would accost and beat me for stuff I did not do and I was helpless to stop. The only problem the managers have with me is that I have too many mental health days (otherwise, I'm considered the perfect worker from the leads and supervisor. The staff at the school are constantly complimenting my work), and that incident only made it worse (I was doing way better about showing up until that incident). I only have access to a low income clinic that mainly treats schizophrenia, bipolar, and depression. I have depression attached to my chronic PTSD. My anxiety disorders make it hard for me to function in public, but the clinic doesnt really treat anxiety. The best they can do is medication which I've tried plenty and had no good success with. And my anxiety makes me stoic and deadpan so no one knows I'm having panic attacks unless I'm crying which I try not to do in public often. 

The only thing keeping me at this job is that I'm holding on to my girlfriend's belongings until she gets out of prison. She wants to return to her son and I assume settle down to operate her own business. As much as I want to be in the picture with her, I dont know if I can. I have to keep paying rent to keep her belongings safe until she gets out. Other than that, I really don't want to be in this roach infested place working a job with that much hostility from my coworkers. I've never been on the streets. I know people on the street because I frequent a soup kitchen, and we're on good terms. But i've always been sheltered and spent most of my life, including partially into adulthood, dependent on others. This is the first time I've been by myself. I am suicidal over all of this, feeling self destructive. My girlfriend and my love for her is the only thing keeping me from giving up. 

I knew the world was shitty from how I came up, but when people say this, they tend to have family support (and if not, it's cause their family physically died). It was my family that made me realize how shitty the world is--from what happened to them and how they treated me in response to their own trauma to our inability to have access to basic needs. 

I was sleeping on the couch in the living room in an overcrowded situation when I left them. I had to deal with tantrums and having glass and pots thrown at me because someone else made them mad. I don't have a license or a car. I couldnt go back to that even if I wanted to. There is no room for me. That fear that I lived with is why I never left them; they were all I had, and the world wouldn't get better. I'm reminded of that often as I navigate the world on my own. They said and told me they didn't want me there with them, so I am unwanted over there. 

I just want to know is it rose colored to just accept my fate with homelessness? I know I'm not going to survive, but I dont care. I'm suicidal. I never been around drugs to get hooked on them. I dont have much stuff, and the few things that I have I dont really care about. I do care about making sure my girlfriend gets her things because it was unfair how shit went down with her. When she gets out, I dont know if we'll really last because we have two separate ideas on what we want in life. I almost felt hopeful in that shelter enough to fall in love. I dont know about now.",6,0.88,11,2025-10-04 20:01:27,_afflatus,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/1ny9kj0/do_you_think_its_rosy_colored_for_someone_who_has/,True,search,69.0700619325,1.8333333333333333,0.0868683164909221,0.08827402755974187,0.4820120355834644,5661,1072
1nlzi2o,homeless,Investigate Unethical Eviction Practices in Utah Titan Legal | The Law Offices of Kirk A. Cullimore,"# The Issue

In 2022, I experienced firsthand the ruthless eviction practices by The Office of Kirk Cullimore, interwoven with discriminatory treatment by Eagle Heights Village in Utah. After a major surgery, just as I was regaining my footing at work, life threw me another curveball. Despite doing everything I could, applying and getting approved for rental assistance, my family faced an unimaginable eviction crisis.  
  
Still recovering from surgery, the confidence of a steady future was shattered when Eagle Heights Village refused the rental assistance I was entitled to. They draped my account with an inflated balance of over $5,000, making it impossible to get rental assistance. Without warning, they issued a 30-day eviction notice, forcing us to face homelessness. It wasn't just about me; it was my family who stood on the brink of losing everything.  
  
My story is not unique. Numerous tenants across Utah have been caught in vicious cycles of fear instigated by unethical eviction practices. The Office of Kirk Cullimore has a notorious reputation, notorious for lack of transparency and harsh eviction measures that leave families in distress. It is high time we demand accountability and justice.  
  
Utah's eviction rates have surged recently, underscoring a systemic failure to protect tenants, potentially violating housing rights. Furthermore, data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development reveal alarming trends in housing insecurities, with a burgeoning number of families affected by dubious eviction practices.  
  
We must advocate for a thorough investigation into these unethical practices by The Office of Kirk Cullimore. Our goal is to ensure they adhere to legal standards and humane procedures in eviction cases. A comprehensive review by housing authorities and legal entities will bring to light the depths of these practices and could pave the way for legislative reforms.  
  
Sign this petition to help prevent future injustices and to stand in solidarity with Utah residents who are battling to keep a roof over their heads. Together, we can urge policymakers to hold accountable those responsible and instigate progressive changes in housing laws. Your signature has the power to transform lives and bring hope to those who have faced despair. Stand with us today.

  
I just started the petition ‚ÄúInvestigate Unethical Eviction Practices in Utah‚Äù and wanted to see if you could help by adding your name. [https://chng.it/Y4NkJcQpjk](https://chng.it/Y4NkJcQpjk)

1nwptuk,povertyfinance,Lack of Ambition,"After nearly four years on the local housing authority waiting list my name finally came up for a 1 bedroom unit. This is public housing not section 8. The rent is based upon my income. For lack of a better word it‚Äôs the projects. I‚Äôm on the side where the smaller units are for older people and small young families. I‚Äôm 48 divorced no children. Not in perfect health I do have some chronic conditions I‚Äôm being treated for but not completely disabled. 

Prior to this I was in a program for domestic violence survivors that paid my rent for 6 months. 

My mom died unexpectedly in June after a brave nearly 5 years battle with breast cancer. I got a little  money and used it to pay off a few bills, save for emergencies, pay my utilities and rent up for a few months, I bought a car, fix up my place and do a few kind deeds for those who helped me along the way. 

I‚Äôm going back to work at the end of the month. I just need to take a breather. 

Baring the implementation of time limits for housing assistance I‚Äôm going to stay put if I‚Äôm allowed to. That may mean working a lower paying job than I could get or cutting back hours to remain eligible. 

A man I‚Äôm very interested in dating told me that I lack ambition. I don‚Äôt think that really ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs more that I want to make sure I‚Äôm ok with housing. Partners and roommates can be unreliable, jobs come n go, rents are very high. Both my parents are gone, I have no siblings nor anyone I can count on if I were to find myself homeless or in a bad situation. 

Due to my health I‚Äôm a bit limited as to the types of work I can do . I‚Äôm just not confident in the situation overall to leave public housing voluntary, attempting to rent in the private market and I‚Äôm staying put if I can. 

The apartment is clean, bright, has washer/dryer hookups, is on the first floor and has parking. I bought a nice used washer/dryer set from a refurbished appliance place so I no longer have to worry about the laundromat unless I‚Äôm washing big rugs or comforters. In short, it has everything I need. 

I applied years ago for housing because I knew the day would come when I‚Äôd be alone and need the help. He thinks that I should strive to improve and leave public housing and not doing so is lazy of me. 

Am I really lazy or just a realist about my situation? ",20,0.95,18,2025-10-03 00:41:07,Successful_Read_1622,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1nwptuk/lack_of_ambition/,True,search,112.40909336583333,0.9,0.17792154888137357,0.08521532091097309,0.4714763630089717,2319,446
1nzz1au,povertyfinance,"So a story, but i imagine reality for a lot of us (TX)","TL;DR: Renewing benefits sucks, and they make it so hard. I can‚Äôt imagine being old and doing this. But our current administration has to make things hard for us‚Äîand we‚Äôre the ones suffering. Yet somehow, they keep sending tax dollars overseas and giving billionaires more tax breaks.

Sorry, it‚Äôs a long read and a story for those of you that care. This is what it‚Äôs like relying on assistance in Texas, in the United States.

I‚Äôm not one to share everything personal that happens to me, and I‚Äôm not asking for pity. I‚Äôm also not ashamed that I need assistance, because I‚Äôm going to do what I can‚Äîwhile I‚Äôm able‚Äîto support my kids.

To start this off, last month it was time to renew our food stamps. When I got the notice, it was dated 09/15/2025. When were all my documents due? That same day, because they notified me late.

Fortunately (or so I thought), all my financial information was still the same since the school year had just started. I hadn‚Äôt been paid for working full-time yet, so I could still use the same info as the summer. So lucky for me, I just resubmitted all the same info‚Äîof course with updated unemployment payments.

I submitted everything and forgot about it for a while. Then on 10/01/2025, I got a notification that they denied me because I ‚Äúdid not provide the required information.‚Äù How is that possible when it was all the same documents from the last renewal?

So I called immediately. After 20 minutes on hold, a nice lady helped me out and said, ‚ÄúYeah, that is weird. I don‚Äôt understand why they would deny you when I see all the documents right here. I‚Äôll go ahead and submit a complaint and get it escalated for you.‚Äù

Awesome. This lady did her job perfectly and helped me out. I was feeling good because there‚Äôs no way they could deny me again‚Äîright?

Now to today, 10/06/2025. They called me while I was working (of course, the one day I‚Äôm working). At least I get out at 3:30, so that still gave me time to call back. I called immediately after work.

The first lady said something like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure why they denied you again. I see all the documents here, and the reasoning they gave is pretty vague, so let me get you to someone else.‚Äù That‚Äôs fine‚ÄîI figured that would happen anyway since this was an ‚Äúescalated case.‚Äù

I got to the next lady, and she said, ‚ÄúYou needed to turn in a verification of payments made for you by somebody else.‚Äù I asked her, ‚ÄúWhat does that mean? Because the last lady I spoke to said I did provide everything. I even asked about that form because it sounded weird, and she said I didn‚Äôt need to send anything else.‚Äù

The lady asked, ‚ÄúHave you received housing assistance before?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, I have,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúbut that was last year. Why do you need that now? I‚Äôve renewed my benefits at least three times since then and no one has ever asked me for that.‚Äù
She replied, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure why they didn‚Äôt before, but you need it now‚Äîand it needs to say when you stopped receiving housing assistance.‚Äù

I told her, ‚ÄúOkay, well I‚Äôll try to send you what I can right now.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want to hang up, because if I did, that would mean waiting even longer to try to get approved. Thankfully, she said she was okay waiting.

I was frantically looking through any documents, emails, or downloads that might have the information she needed. I did find the housing assistance award letter that said how much I received, but it didn‚Äôt say when I stopped getting it.

So I came back on the line and asked, ‚ÄúAre you sure there isn‚Äôt anything else I can provide? Because I do have letters that say what my living situation was and when I moved out from relatives, and they‚Äôre signed and dated.‚Äù
The rep said, ‚ÄúWell, I do see those, but I need something more. Can you provide a letter written by you, with your name, date, and signature? If you upload it right now while we‚Äôre on the phone, I can get you approved.‚Äù

I said, ‚ÄúYes! I‚Äôll do that right away‚Äîplease stay with me!‚Äù She agreed to stay on the phone with me so I could get the document ready.

Because that was never asked for before, I had to write the letter while on the phone. For some reason, my phone wouldn‚Äôt let me sign the Word document. The rep interrupted, ‚ÄúI can only stay about five more minutes. If not, you‚Äôll have to call back again tomorrow and renew again.‚Äù

That meant I‚Äôd have to go through all of this again and might not get food stamps for October. I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry! I already made the letter‚ÄîI just have to upload it! Hang on please!‚Äù

So I kept going. I downloaded an app that let me add my signature to the document, got that added, downloaded the new signed version, and got ready to upload.

Since I‚Äôve dealt with food stamps before, I know their website is very picky about documents. The file name can‚Äôt have special characters or numbers, and it must be a PDF. So I got that squared away, let her know I uploaded it, and she started looking at it right away.

The rep said, ‚ÄúOkay! So I got you approved now! But because of YOU turning in the documents late, we do have to prorate the amount for six days.‚Äù (So the total I get for the month divided by 31, that number times six days‚Äîthat‚Äôs what they take away from me for October.)

Unbelievable, honestly. Because of their mistakes, I get screwed over‚Äîtheir mistake being that I wasn‚Äôt told correctly what I needed to submit the first time, or the second time, and now today they needed something completely different than what I‚Äôve ever had to send in before.

She read me all the rules and the usual information, and I was just glad to finally be off the phone. Total time on the phone: 1 hour and 13 minutes.

Believe me, I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs fixed‚Äîbut I can‚Äôt imagine if I was old, didn‚Äôt have a phone or computer, didn‚Äôt know how to change a document to a PDF, didn‚Äôt know the document had to have a specific name, or didn‚Äôt know what to submit in general. I am at the will of the state of Texas. But for my daughters, I‚Äôll jump through all those hoops‚Äîthat‚Äôs fine.

I just want you to think about this the next time someone says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so easy to get benefits. You don‚Äôt even have to work, and they just give it away to illegals‚Äîthey‚Äôre stealing our tax dollars üí∏.‚Äù

You do have to work. You have to jump through all these hoops. And undocumented immigrants can‚Äôt even get federal benefits like SNAP or Medicaid.

It‚Äôs not easy‚Äîit‚Äôs been made harder and harder every year. For what? So that people who actually need help get denied because of one paper? Then they have to wait another month just to see what the decision might be?

In a month, people starve. I know there can be other resources, but we‚Äôre running out‚Äîbecause our current administration wants to give tax cuts to billionaires, send tax money overseas, and fund wars we don‚Äôt need to be in.

But again, remind me how it‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerica first.‚Äù

Share if you want‚ÄîI just needed to vent. This is the reality for so many people, and I hate that there are so many who just don‚Äôt care.

Edit: I hope its easier to read now! I do want this taken seriously so got it cleaned up, I appreciate hearing your feedback and experiences too! ü©∑ if i dont respond I will soon! We need to support each other! I hope we can find actual peace in the world where everyone is taken care of and loved.",2,0.55,8,2025-10-06 19:32:39,Slight_Rub_3011,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1nzz1au/so_a_story_but_i_imagine_reality_for_a_lot_of_us/,True,search,21.550205339166666,4.0,0.09280654028688429,0.07648478366251805,0.4839015151515152,7288,1356

1nzj3hb,povertyfinance,"I was a highly-paid IT specialist in Spain. I sent one message promoting a union and lost everything. After a year on the streets, I have a room and ‚Ç¨110 to fight back. How do you stay sane?","Hi Reds,

Three years ago, I had it all. I was a Scrum Master/Agile Coach at One Another Giant IT/Tech Company for a five years, then invited to Spain (other ""division"") as a high-skilled professional. Good salary, a nice apartment in 250k town, a future

Then I sent a message in a company-wide chat where suggested my colleagues look into joining a union to protect our rights. That's it. That was my ""crime"", bruh

Days later, I was called into an office and fired. They called it ""restructuring."" I call it retaliation. They offered me about ‚Ç¨10k to sign a paper and disappear quietly. I refused. It was a matter of principle

That principle cost me everything. My job, my savings, my apartment, my legal status. I spent most of last year in homeless shelters

Today, thanks to the Red Cross, I have a small room in one town in Galicia and have ‚Ç¨110 to my name. Now fighting a legal battle that could, in theory, win me my job back and around ‚Ç¨180k in back pay (50% I have to give to the labor union if I win, since they are handling this case). My appeal has been sitting in a high court for six months with zero updates. I can't leave Spain, or I automatically lose

I'm not asking for money. I'm asking for perspective, or maybe any advices how to survive when exists such strict frames and restrictions on rights: my lawyer jokingly calls this ""a legal (juridical) limbo or even Catch-22"" referring to the Spanish system

Every logical part of my brain says I should have taken the money. But my gut says that if people like me don't fight, these corporations will crush everyone. In other words, let's say that ""I'm stuck between principle and pragmatism, living a Kafka or Dostoevskiy novel""

For anyone who's ever fought a seemingly impossible battle against a system designed to wear you down ‚Äì what was the one small thing that kept you from giving up?

1ngx01e,homeless,Been homeless for years here is my advise/what i have learned from my views,"Lol iv been homeless probably 60% my life (started at like 13 and im 31 now) of course iv had bits of being in houses ect however somethings iv learned over the years i wanna share so im posting this for new homelessness humans not asking for money just giving advise (idk why AI is suggesting i am asking for money silly robot) 

(Disclaimer not everything here suggested is 100% legal im not saying everything is the best route to take or best action im just saying iv done it iv lived reasearch the laws to your area while im good with law i am not a lawyer)  also leads me to a new tip, LEARN LAWS AND YOUR RIGHTS WHILE BEING HOMELESS

Now for those who dont drive and dont like where you are and wanna escape

-hitchhiking- it can be super fun, interesting way to meet people/get jobs/money ect iv managed to hitch hike aus, canada, NZ, US, mexico, parts of europe only 2 bad exp and only 1 of those was actually bad bad where i had to put someones car into a ditch for not letting me out of the car at my destination (cops arrested him he got charged with 2 seperate murders of hitchhikers so ya kinda sketchy) however iv seen some the coolest shit hitchhiking other side coin you may get some super religious people

-trainhopping- super dangerous altho thrilling and you see parts of country youd never see hitchhiking

-rideshares- i hate em absolutely always let me down do not reccomend 

*those with wheels* 
Drive where you wanna go, panhandle truckstops for gas write a sign says ""traveling broke need gas and or a job"" you will get gas and or a job for day to get gas 

*Sleeping spots* 

Holidays - ie christmas sleep in a bank trust me iv wokem up with enough money to rent apartments in past but doesnt always work

Campgrounds- by far my favorite spot to hit up i normally go in at dark and out super early i havent paid to camp in years even in provincial parks make sure you do have cash to cover spot incase they show up later then like 830pm 

Sides of roads in cubbys- can be profitable however business's will probably call cops but if you ask for a broom/window cleaner and help maintain the spot most wont care however your exposed to people and well they are unpredicible

Parks- tenting in a park is well in my exp terrible you are gonna get woken up 100% 

Tent citys - just stay away if your sober you wont be long if you stay regardless what you think takes getting drunk once to say yes just dont go unless your already in active addiction lots cops, lots thiefts and stabbings/murders ect (google invincible green surrey BC) i actually knew this giy in real life, before i found out he was a rapist however that being said he was sober until he went to a tent city now hes doing time in jail for murdering someone with a crossbow + the rape of a minor from like 10 years before

*Panhandling* 

Panhandle medians 100% more profitable then sitting in a bar district 

*Quick jobs* 

picking fruit- okanogan BC canada every spring-fall is screaming for pickers if you do it right and party off the quebecers that love to party (of course contribute when you can to the party if they are hurting) you can live in a inclusive hotel in mexico for winter (ice grapes are best profit) 

Picking flowers- east coast canada lots of flower farms also need pickers imo doesnt pay as well as fruit 

Busking- if you play, i suggest doing it in bar districts be prepared to play wonderwall on repeat basically (i have a sign says wonderwall is a 20 dollar request)lol 

Temp labour - i hate these but they are a nessisary evil that can result in full time work 

Shelters/drop ins/gyms

Some shelters mostly small town are great once your in city things can go well or terrible depends on shelter/drop in 

Personally i got a gym membership so i can shower i try to avoid shelters/drop ins i just dont like the vibes of them personally but they help lots people and have good resources however if you are youth ie 14-24 your shelters are better then those of us who have aged out

Pets 

I have a dog, 2 cats im currently homeless with i work full time as well they have there plus sides (not so much the cats) and major downsides

Pros-
-Your gonna know if someones stealing fRom you  
-You always have something when you feel like giving up 
-They always love you 

Cons
-If you dont got a car/truck/RV good luck getting out of the weather, shelters normally wont take you the emergancy cold shelters some of them will 
-Costs money to have them but people will give you endless food for them like endless 
-SPCA/bylaw some citys will take your animal if your homeless regardless how well you care for them always search bylaws and gtfo of towns that will apprehend them with out question

Sleeping arrangements 
I hate tents imma tell you with 100% that hammock has been best bed i ever had when i didnt have a wheels they are lighter, not as bulky 

Eating
Panning most resteraunts will get you food personally i like to cook my own i got 2 burner stove and carry charcoal (again i drive so find something that suites your needs) some use hiking stoves 

The groups of people you wanna chill with
So im always gonna go look for the folk punks like 100% and even that crowd can be hit and miss but 95% of them are super welcoming and inclusive of everyone but theres bad eggs in all crowds ie jesse stewart before he died (miss you arlo(his dog was a gem) 

Also females please for love of god be careful way to many things happen to you all no matter what croud you are in please be cautious of fkn everyone i mean everyone esspecially if you are a people pleaser that struggles saying no to people carry a knife or if american in a place you can carry please fkn carry something a 22 handgun is better then nothing i promise you this so many women i know beem assulted amd many have kids from it and its absolutely heart breaking

1nepbmk,povertyfinance,Looking for light at the end of the tunnel,"Basically, I'm looking for advice on ways someone who is very ill, both acute and chronically, can earn money from home. 

Personal Background to explain limitations: I was poisoned in an attempted murder as a child and didn't learn about it for twenty years. We just thought it was a severe gastric issue, as there are enough inflammatory disorders in the family to justify it. The gastric issues alone were grounds for eventual SSDI, but that didn't happen until I was 30. I was diagnosed with late stage embryonal carcinoma when I was 24. By that point I had already been shot and stabbed while working security jobs to help pay college costs. This isn't me being weepy; I'm just saying old injuries add up. I did some very illegal things to cover the non-negotiable costs of cancer treatment, accepted the rest of the medical debt, was homeless most of the time, but I survived and the debt was eventually written off. That was 2008 to 2010. I then learned I had been dosed with a chemotherapy treatment regimen that would've killed about 19 of every 20 people. (Doc was a quack who fled the country.) I suffered extensive nerve damage, including corneal neuropathy (constant chopping onions sting for 15 years straight now), and developed an immune disorder called Sjogren's Syndrome which is causing me to lose my teeth. I managed to obtain Medicare and qualified for their Extra Help program, so most of my extensive medical needs are covered, else I'd have died quite a while back. The dental is not covered, so I have to accept that I will lose all my teeth within roughly the next ten years. (Already missing two and having the third pulled tomorrow)

Present: I am now on my third cancer diagnosis, developed Lupus (fatigue worse than chemo, passing out if I stand for too long, and mental fog), have an SO, managed to get a house while they were still cheapish, cracked three bones in my neck and herniated six discs, meaning I'm pretty much a physical invalid, am in constant significant pain, and have to wear weird lenses over my eyes so they don't dry out to the point they're non-functional. I should, by all rights, be dead. But there are people in my life who desperately wish me to keep fighting. I'm trying, but I've got no idea what I can do to earn an income, and what we are suffering from is having far more expenses than our savings and income can cover. 

A bad storm recently caused our roof to partially collapse. We have a decent insurance policy, but it's been a month fighting with the adjuster, and I may have to take it to court to get them to budge since the policy is fairly clear on this one. Out of pocket, it would be over 50k to fix, and there's easily another 200k worth of work needed on a house we still owe 80k on. Sadly, we're still better off than anyone else in my family or my SO's family, meaning we can't borrow the money. We had been breaking even up to that point and have been able to retain about 20k in liquid assets. If we take out a loan without having another income stream, we'll lose it all. In the meantime, the house rots around us and cars get older. (No public transit available.)

Collectively, we take home maybe $45k a year, depending on taxes. I have degrees in psychology and English lit. Came damn close to being a successful author until the Lupus caused the brain fog, worked in the publishing industry for a short while, and I am not trying to get my master's and work as a therapist purely because this damn brain fog means I don't have the memory or cognitive function I once did. My SO was thinking about training me in medical billing, specifically the forms any healthcare practitioner must submit to get an insurance company to pay out because that's a job normally done by third parties. I look online for jobs, but I'm a bit of a luddite and can't tell the scams and ghost jobs versus the real ones, so I can't figure out what there's a demand for. 

Any suggestions for WFH that isn't a strict 9-5 (constant doctor's visits) and doesn't require video conference stuff? (I'm not exactly going to look professional without a new set of teeth, new clothes, plus there's the whole Uncle Fester look from chemo.) If I need to train skillsets, that's fine. I am good with Excel and Word, but have been out of an office environment for 15 years, so know very little about a lot of programs that all seem to do the same thing, just by another name. My greatest skill has always been the ability to take in a vast amount of information quickly, process it, and apply it. Examples would be for newspaper articles, web zines (which aren't hiring anymore), research papers, and various reports to a company or department. Also, I absolutely suck at any form of programming or coding. Been taking and failing courses in it for years.

I know that's a lot of accommodation, but it's due to extensive limitations from illness and injury, not because I won't learn new skills or do the job. If my takehome was as little as 20k a year, that would still be a world of difference. More would be better, of course, but I'm trying to temper hope with realism. 

Thank you for reading. I know it's a lot. And there's a lot more I'm not saying.

I managed to put away about $1k before today.

Between us we have about 4k. Rent is 1500. We live by ourselves. 

We were honestly probably living above our means beforehand. This is a shit check. I'm trying to fend off the panic. Our third in the throuple kind of broke up with me this morning. I'm trying so hard to be strong for him right now but I haven't been in this kind of situation before and I'm not really sure what to do.

Please help.

EDIT: Additional information:

I work 28 a week. That's the most my employer will give me. I don't drive, don't have a license, so 28 at 18/hr is probably about the best I can do. (The 4000/1500 numbers were after taxes, so it's 80% of what the math says.) If I absolutely need to supplement that, I'll find something to do the other 12.

We'll apply for unemployment in the morning; he's torn to pieces right now. I'll make sure he gets a letter. We live in Grand Rapids, MI.

We were living in a 3-bed with the third, who we took in a year ago when she lost her job, but now she wants to move out. She says I make her feel like shit and I can't dispute it. She did not contribute financially. I would really like to find a 1-bed and downsize as much as I can but I don't know how finding housing is going to work until we get back on our feet.

I‚Äôm going through a divorce and my husband took everything (the car, the apartment, the furniture, the money) and is MIA for the most part. I‚Äôm living with my best friend and her husband, who have already shared all they can with me. They have good countertops. I have zero countertops. This month, it was go to the food bank or don‚Äôt eat. 

I‚Äôm making taco salads every day for lunch with the chicken, beans, rice, romaine, limes, some salsa I had, and some cherry tomatoes from my garden. I figured out how to can, so I made four jars of pickles so far. I had to give away the bread, Oreos, tortillas and pasta to a friend since I‚Äôm allergic to wheat. I squeezed limes and made lime juice ice cubes, froze some lime zest, and borrowed a friend‚Äôs juicer to make orange juice with all the oranges. I‚Äôve only used two bags of the 6 bags of limes they gave me so I‚Äôm going to bring some to work. I also made a pie crust with oats, butter, and sugar and made a pie with the yellow plums. 

Next week I‚Äôm going to use the rice, chicken, green beans, and bok choy to make stir fry, and freeze some bok choy for egg drop soup feat. bok choy the next week. 

I posted this to encourage people to visit their own food banks. I went to a church food bank in an affluent suburban neighborhood. I know my experience is probably rare. I didn‚Äôt even want to tell my friends I live with but they‚Äôve helped me process and cook the food a lot, so I‚Äôm sharing this abundance where I can, even though they themselves are not in need like I am.

1nz08ev,povertyfinance,Expenses higher than income after family help ends. How to budget smarter?,"Hi everyone,

I know I‚Äôm still more privileged than many here, so I don‚Äôt want to come across as playing the victim. I just want practical budgeting advice before this gets worse.

I‚Äôm(38F), husband (40M), we have one toddler (18 months), two large dogs.

Husband has been unemployed for over a year. Despite 200+ applications, no job offers yet.

I work as a private music teacher + part-time ESL teacher. My steady income is about $3,500‚Äì$4,000/month.

Family has been giving us $2,000/month to cover the gap, but that ends very soon.

Monthly Expenses (rounded):

Mortgage: $600

Utilities: $700

Groceries/household: $1,250

Child expenses: $175

Pets: $300

Debt payments: $400

Insurance (health, car, home): $500

Gas/transportation: $100

Subscriptions/extras: $200
Total: ~$4,275 (this actually doesn‚Äôt include the home maintenance like mowing the lawn, pest control, etc)

Once family support ends, I‚Äôll be short $275‚Äì$775/month, which obviously is not sustainable. We have a big house/yard, two dogs, and a toddler, which make cutting expenses tricky. I don‚Äôt want to keep borrowing or sliding into debt.

- Where would you start cutting, realistically?
- How do I decide what‚Äôs truly essential vs. what can go?
- Any tips for reducing utilities, groceries, or managing pets on a smaller budget?
- Has anyone been in a similar spot where one partner was out of work long-term? How did you get through?

Please don't judge. I have been sicker than a dog for the past 2 days (suspecting covid). I'm weak, bad cough, runny nose, my throat feels like its on fire. I've also barely had anything to eat bc I'm fucking poor as hell. I just want some fruit or veggies, thats it. I just want real food. 

Literally $6 in my savings and my checking has less than $12 in it. 

I feel like i'm getting sicker bc I haven't been getting vital nutrients into my body.

- I do not have a vehicle, but through my state Medicaid will drive me to a food bank as long as I call 48 hrs ahead of time. I will be calling around tomorrow.'



**Edit: Ok I'm going to the E R. now. I'm tired of the mean comments saying I'm drug seeking, or lying about my symptoms.

1ngmpv9,povertyfinance,Need advice/help to avoid eviction after job loss & health issues,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm hoping for advice or resources to avoid eviction and stay in my home. (TLDR at bottom)

Background:
I used to live in Kahana in a small room in a three-bedroom shared house. About a week before the Lahaina fires, I made a large purchase on my Chase credit card, maxing out a $1,000 limit. My plan was to pay it off immediately, as my PBX operator job at Hyatt could sustain me. But when the fires hit, I panicked and, following my father‚Äôs advice, used my paycheck to pay rent in advance because I was temporarily out of work.

During the Lahaina fires, I reached out to resources available to help those affected. Because I was only indirectly affected‚Äîthe line of fire did not hit my home directly‚ÄîI did not qualify for aid. I was temporarily allowed to stay at my workplace hotel for three days, but had to leave because the rooms were needed for EMTs and emergency personnel assisting with recovery. Returning to my home was difficult due to my chronic illnesses.

After the hotel resumed operations, my landlord gave me a notice to vacate because he wanted to downsize‚Äîhe lost his mechanic business in the fires. With my father‚Äôs help, I moved into a new home in Kihei with a one-year lease for $1,100/month.

When I first moved into my Kihei apartment, the realty firm that manages the property signed me to a one-year lease at $1,100/month. About six months in, they emailed me saying that because of ‚Äúmarket prices,‚Äù they were raising the rent to $1,300/month and also requiring the security deposit to match that amount.

Before I started receiving rental assistance from MEO, I was also told that the HUD assistance they had a contract with‚Äîbasically a program that would have allowed the government to cover part of my rent for a set period of time and prevent increases‚Äîhad ended because they did not renew their contract. Very bizarre to me.

Health & Job Loss:
While working my graveyard PBX shift at Hyatt, I developed moderate-severity sleep apnea. I fell asleep at work multiple times, initially thinking it was due to uncontrolled diabetes, diagnosed depression, diagnosed anxiety, or diagnosed ADHD (I‚Äôm taking medication and therapy) I had been receiving rental assistance from Maui Economic Opportunity (MEO) to recover from credit card debt and student loans, with the goal of fully paying off my debts and then using future paychecks to create a savings cushion in case another big event occurred.

On four separate occasions, I was given write-ups for falling asleep at work. Each time, a team member secretly took a photo of me but did not wake me to resume my shift. This felt underhanded and cruel, particularly because I was struggling with diagnosed sleep apnea. (I know they do not have to be my friend but come on man that feels scummy) The last occurrence on June 22nd led to my suspension. After about two months, I finally received a CPAP machine 1.5 months later and returned to work with HR‚Äôs consent.

HR suggested I switch shifts to protect my health. I requested a shift change, but the manager explained that all other shifts were held by higher-seniority full-time employees who weren‚Äôt leaving their positions, and there were no open bids. The only other options were to switch departments entirely or go part-time, which wouldn‚Äôt provide consistent hours. About one week into my CPAP therapy and two weeks after returning to work, I nodded off again at my graveyard shift, which led to my termination for the fourth and now final time.

Financial Situation:
Since losing my job three months ago, I‚Äôve fallen behind on nearly all bills. Current status:

Living Expenses & Utilities:
	‚Ä¢	Rent: $2,808.00 (2 months overdue)
	‚Ä¢	Kaiser Permanente Health Insurance: $0 (my meds have co-pays)
	‚Ä¢	Apria Healthcare: $53.00 (copay of my cpap supplies)
	‚Ä¢	Hawaiian Electric (HECO): $1,063.68
	‚Ä¢	Geico: $100.19

Credit Cards & Loans:
	‚Ä¢	Capital One: $304.13
	‚Ä¢	Chase: $1,443.31
	‚Ä¢	Verizon Wireless (phone bill): $501.02
	‚Ä¢	Loan from best friend (1st month I was jobless): $2,300.00

Current cash available: $1.00

I really don‚Äôt want to move from my current home if possible. I can‚Äôt go live with my father cause he doesn‚Äôt have room nor funds to support me since he is retired and living on fixed income. I have already tried negotiating with my landlord in the past when I thought I wouldn‚Äôt be able to pay rent. They have been kind enough this time; at the start of this second month overdue, they asked how my job hunting was going and when I would be able to pay. At the same time, they sent an email stating I was in arrears with two months overdue rent.

Through my friend‚Äôs help, I called Aloha United Way via their national 211 line to seek any additional help, but I was told that only Catholic Charities, Family Life Center, and MEO were available‚Äîoptions I already knew about and nothing else. I was hoping someone, anywhere, might know of other ways to help me get out of this situation.

Eviction context:
	‚Ä¢	Hawai‚Äòi law: Minimum 5 business days to pay or quit for nonpayment of rent.
	‚Ä¢	Catholic Charities & Family Life Center: Require a 30‚Äì45 day written notice before they can step in.
	‚Ä¢	Landlords in Maui County can give longer notices if they choose, which may help provide time to seek assistance.

I now have a new job paying $18/hour‚Äîwell below my living wage of $24‚Äì28/hour. Catholic Charities and Family Life Center say they can only help if I have an eviction notice or need future rent payments (but I can‚Äôt be overdue) 

I‚Äôm unsure whether to wait for an eviction notice, negotiate further somehow with my landlord, or move to a cheaper place. Any advice on emergency assistance, anything physically helpful would be deeply appreciated.

TL;DR:
I lost my PBX job at Hyatt after being diagnosed with sleep apnea, fell behind on rent (now 2 months overdue), and my landlord has been patient but I may face eviction soon. Catholic Charities/Family Life Center require a 30‚Äì45 day eviction notice to help, but Hawaii law only gives 5 days. I‚Äôve already tried MEO and United Way with little luck, and I‚Äôm working again but at a much lower wage ($18 vs. $24‚Äì28 needed). Looking for any advice, resources, or options to avoid losing my home.

1nckra6,povertyfinance,PSA to Anyone Struggling with Food Insecurity!,"PLEASE USE LOCAL FOOD BANKS. 

You can use food banks even if you already have food at home. You can use food banks even if you have money to buy food. You can use food banks even if you are only temporarily struggling financially. You can use food banks even if you aren't on the verge of starvation. You can use food banks even if you have a car. You can use food banks even if you have nice things. You can use food banks even if you are employed. You can use food banks even if you are unemployed. You can use food banks even if you are eligible or already receieving government aid.

The use of food banks is heavily stigmatized and misunderstood. Not wanting to use one out of the belief that you don't truly need it, so that the people who do can have access to the resources they need, is perfectly understandable and admirable. But understanding when you need it is the part that some struggle with as it is often stigmatized as a personal failure or only for people who are in extreme poverty. Food banks are there to help anyone, and they receive funding based on the number of people who use the service. So by not utilizing this resource, you are only setting yourself back as well as not allowing the food bank to give an accurate figure to report to receive funding. 

Food banks help fill the nutritional gaps in you diet, as well as providing food that you may not have access to, meaning it is okay to use them even if you already have food at home. Just because you have rice and potatoes at home, does not mean you can't go to pick up a protein source and some vegetables/fruits to supplement your diet. 

Food banks are there to help you free up money in your budget, so that you don't have to pick and choose which bills to pay or fall behind on something just to eat. You do not need to neglect getting maintenance work done on your car or getting your healthcare needs met, so that you can afford food. It is okay to go even if you technically have money in your account to buy food, but that money could help you out significanlty if it went elsewhere.

Food banks are the perfect option for those who are only temporarily struggling as they require less commitment than applying for social services. They are there to help bridge the gap needed during financial hardships due to any cause. You do not need a good enough reason in order to go. 

Food banks are there so that people do not go hungry, as no one should know what that feels like. Even if you aren't on the verge of starvation or extreme nutritional deficits, you should still go as you deserve a warm, satisfying meal to look forward to each day. 

Food banks are great for those who don't have access to transportation or nearby grocery stores, but that doesn't mean you can't use one if you have a car. Sometimes, access to a car is all you have and it will only help you bring your food home easier. You do not need to sell your car or any of your possessions first, before you consider going to a food bank. People can go through extreme financial changes in only a short period of time, and the food bank is there to help. If you really want, you can offer to give someone a ride home at the food bank who had to walk there. 

No matter whether you are employed or unemployed, the food bank is there so that you do not have to go without food as no one deserves to suffer in that way. Whether you need the energy for work, or applying to jobs and attending interviews, your body and your health matters and the food bank is there to help you meet your needs. 

Government aid does not always meet everyone's needs, especially with the ongoing changes happening and restrictions on what you are allowed to buy. So even if you are already receiving help, it is okay to go to the food bank to cover the gaps. That is exactly what it is intended to do.

If you are still uncomfortable with the idea of utilizing a food bank, you can always pay it forward. You can use it now when you need it, and donate or volunteer to one when you are in a better position. 

I wish you all the best <3 and please utilize your local library for more help as they can provide information on local resources, help you apply for government assistance, and many even provide free seeds to grow your own food.

1nnryuw,povertyfinance,Army won't let me enlist because I've been in an mental institution?,"I posted on here before and got great advice. I've been trying everything. I talked to a recruiter for about a month, but I don't know what to do anymore. I passed PT assessments. I did the MEPS process and signed the contract. I was supposed to be leaving out for basic training on the 26th. I didn't know anything about the mental health guidelines for the military, and I guess they did the background and found out I admitted and stayed in a mental hospital for 10 days. I did, of course. But I did it at a time I most wanted to kill myself.

I'm not eating every day and losing weight. My mom passed away, and I got left alone with the house and lost it. I was working but quit when I got further along in the recruitment process. I thought it was a sure thing.  But I did all of that just for them to ring this up at the last second. And they told me I can't leave out now. I'm trying to escape homelessness, starvation, and depression. This was my only way out, and I'm devastated because I made friends and people who cared that I was supposed to join with. Now I'm stuck back here. With a car that needs an altenator. I can't even move it, and it's the only thing I have. I use it to sleep in. I dropped my classes also, and I truly have nothing going for me. I'm 19 and got hit with this life shit pretty early. I miss my mom so much.

Part of me just wants to be with her at this point. I didn't come to cry, but what would or do you do at this point? I tried but feel like the world is rejecting me. I'm in this car that I can't move, I don't have any friends or family to fall back on right now. Idec about eating anymore. My plan for elevating my life went to shit. I'm feeling depression sink back in. And I never wanted it to come back. I've been crying all day. I feel so alone.

1nv26va,povertyfinance,I changed my relationship with money - cash flow,"i know there is better more professional advice out there, i am not an authority and this is not financial advice this is just the story of my success with changing my personal relationship with money.

months, in fact years, of overspending, credit cards, loans, etc and i never got out of debt, i never saw growth just cost on cost on cost. Then i starting looking at this subreddit and others like it and realized my relationship with money was wrong.

i was living paycheck to paycheck. from 100 to 0 to 100 to  0 again and when i needed to spend more, debt entered the pipeline so i went from 0 to -100 to 100 to 0. if this sounds like you, there is a way out of the cycle. 

here are my realizations, and the steps i took to finally end a fiscal month with cash in my bank account and not zero. i haven't tackled my debt ( which i have plenty ) but i have tackled and solved my cash flow problem, which is the first step before beginning to address the debt problem. 

step 1 - Never spend to zero. (Income and Cash) This pertains specifically to income, but can also apply to cash that you already have on hand whether in savings or in your wallet. the point of money is explicitly not to spend it all. i wish can underline this. i am not moralistic about money, i think life happens and people can have different circumstances but this is one area where i can absolutely be moralistic because this is founded on basic math and arithmetic and is 100% in your control. it's also so simple a child can understand it. if i give you 10 dollars, you must not spend all 10 dollars. you can spend 9.99 (worst case scenario), spend 9, spend 7, spend 5, spend none of it (best case scenario), what ever you do, treat money as zero sum and any number higher than zero is a win. it's a starting point. it's ammunition for another day. this is in essence one of the underlying ideas supporting automatic savings.

step 2 - automatic savings. this works hand in hand with the first step, that no matter what, you never spend all of the money that you have coming in and all of the money that you have on hand. for automatic savings, i developed 3 additional steps for my self.

step 2a - income savings at 10%. this works just like an income tax. if i make 20 dollars from a gig, i straight away put 2 dollars in a jar as soon as i get the money. in other words it's a mental barrier and a physical barrier, if i make 20 bucks in one hour gig that means i really made 18 bucks. this scales and you will instantly see the impact. if i sell a laptop. or get my monthly paycheck these large amounts of money coming in will start to fill out this jar quickly. 10% of 1000 dollars is 100 dollars, this is a meaningful automatic savings.

step 2b - expense savings at 15%. this works like VAT or sales tax. it is a consumption based savings. this means if i go to the store and spend 10 dollars i must without question put 1.50 into a jar to make that purchase. which actually means that if i want to afford a 10 dollar trip to the grocery store then i absolutely need to have at least 11.50 in cash. and this is proportional. ultimately its another trigger that means if i have 10 dollars i must only spend less than 10 dollars and not the whole 10 dollars.

step 2c - cash reserves. i apply a maximum limit of 55% of my cash holding per transaction. this means no matter what, i always keep my cash locked down in a jar and if i want to spend money, say for example i have $100 dollars like how i do right now, that means in my next purchase, regardless of purchase type my goal should be to spend no more than 55% of my balance. that means if i have 100 dollars i only have 55 dollars available for spending. and this works in tandem with step 2b as a multiplier, the 55 dollars must include the automatic 15% expense savings, that means i can only spend [ x + (x * 0.15) = 55 ] or x = 55/1.15 = 47.83 dollars. 

I perceive these steps as a spending and cost control, that allows me to live and spend well within my means. in a nutshell, basic math, if you spend less that what money you make and spend less of what money you already have, then it is virtually impossible to run out of money and you now have built-in automatic growth. and it is so simple that i cannot understand why i never had this relation with money before. it is so obvious in hindsight.

step 3 - almost all purchases can wait! literally if there is no deadline, and no immediate cause of harm for non payment, it can wait! money is a function of time! the worst part about myself, and perhaps my culture is that every financial decision seems like an urgency where you need to buy something now... you don't! 99% of things can wait, and do not fold to pressure. if you _cannot_ afford something today right now in this exact moment, it doesn't mean that you _cannot_ or _will not_ be able to afford it in a week or two when you do a few more gigs and collect more income. and the beauty of waiting is that by the time you collect the cash, if the transaction was not truly critically important you will have forgotten all about it. so always have this conversation with yourself whether you want or need something. ask the follow questions: 1. can i afford it? (is it less that 55% of my cash on hand and can i afford to automatically save 15% of the value of the transaction, ie if you have 100 dollars the most expensive transaction you can perform is 47.83, remember that this scales! if you have 10,000 dollars you can spend 4,783 and so on.) 2. if i can't afford it, do i need it or want it? 3. if i think i need it, do i really need it? (again chances are you don't! for example even if your fridge is sparse, sparse is not the same as empty! you will not starve, if the amount of food you have is greater than 0, more than zero is still something. just eat sandwiches until your next income payment, you will be fine! don't fall into the trap of urgency. literally, unless you are at risk of death/bodily harm, starvation, the utility companies shutting off the lights, your bank hitting you with massively painful late fees, then it is not urgent!!! we are trained by society to see so many non-emergency situations as emergencies. it is lavish. it is literally so damn luxurious. and it needs to stop!)

the outcome of my one month experience with these new steps i went from ending last month with literally 0 dollars to now more than 100 dollars and now i am going to put that 100 dollars into - 3.80% savings account.

just remember folks you can do it! try to do these steps and you should find yourself cost cutting and suddenly spending far less. you will be more deliberate in your spending and you will start stretching out the frequency of your purchases over time (instead of paying for something right now, you can wait a week to earn more cash and pay for it then). simply put, my steps all come down to this:

Spend well within in your means. money going out should be less than money coming in.

that's it. 

with this method i will start saving up an emergency fund, and then after that paying down debts and then once i am debt free i will be a perpetual growth machine and i can start putting all that unspent cash into investments. growth mindset.

the growth relationship with money is simple, all you need to understand is that **the point** of money is **not** to spend it all. once you make this automatic you will never ""run out money"" and you will always have money. it's genuinely so simple, yet people tell themselves it is impossible.

1nlj4bh,povertyfinance,"A lot of nights I eat white rice and hotdog sausages as a meal ,even though I make 80K","Guys, I used to be broke as a joke and clean kitchen floors at 2am and bike from location to location, making like 15/hr

Fast forward 3 years and I am making about 80K a year and I still eat ramen, white rice and chopped up hotdogs. My coworkers probably wonder why I'm always broke and eating the free work kitchen food lol.

Truth is, I spend the money on helping my family and myself. I am almost debt free (for the 2nd time), I am helping family pay off their debts (emergency debts) and helping my aging parents fix their vehicles and offering any assistance they may need (No, they are not greedy and hate when I spend any money on them). 

But even though I make 80K, which is an ok salary as a male with no kids and very very low rent 750/month. I still eat like I can't afford more than 2 meals a day but this is what I wanted. I wanted to be in a position where I could help my family and myself. 

I am still fresh in my career and this is only the beginning, I continue to aim higher so that I can help as much as I can.

My mother is very poor, like.... 850 / month SSI kind of poor.

She needs a place to stay as I'm moving abroad next year.

Trying to find any information on income-based / income-restricted rental places.

She wants to live somewhere warm'ish so like Alabama / Florida is what she'd prefer.

  
Tried contacting a few 'income-based' properties in florida and their response was - lol you need to make a minimum of $25,000 / year to qualify for out 30% of income low-income rent.

Imagine being too poor to qualify for low-income rent... haha.

  
ANyways, was hoping some of you might be able to provide some information if you have any to share.. Please and thanks
