They make it clear that they feel like they are doing us a big favor by feeding us indoors. Bare in mind that I am uncomfortable inside someone's house. I find that most people have such specific ideas of how to open or close their front door,  how to flush their toilet, use the television, which glasses to use for water vs whiskey, what containers to use for left overs, how they get placed in the fridge. All these things make me anxious.  I would rather have stayed in the car. But I digress.

When leaving their place after the festivities are over, they give us the hugs, and tell us,

1jkbguj,povertyfinance,Homeless and crippled - this will be my last day.,"

Hey everyone,


I‚Äôve posted here before, I am from the UK and I‚Äôm homeless and have been for a year. Two years ago I fell out of a lorry and snapped my ankle on the curb. I caused permanent damage to leg and couldn‚Äôt walk for 10 months. I was only getting government sick pay and it didn‚Äôt cover my rent. After 12 months I was evicted, by that time I could walk but I‚Äôve had a limp ever since and have to use a walking stick. The local council say they don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúduty of care‚Äù as I‚Äôm not in a wheelchair. So for the last 12 months I‚Äôve been living in the fucking forest. 

Sadly I‚Äôve realised this week I won‚Äôt ever get better as the pain that has been radiating up my left leg has now moved over to my right leg. The doctor has explained it‚Äôs moved into my hips. I‚Äôm fucking 28. I‚Äôm not doing this anymore! I‚Äôm in constant pain and no pain killers work. Every step I take I‚Äôm in pain, I have no family and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever work again. I‚Äôm useless and poor so I will be ending it tonight at 22:00 at my favourite oak tree. 

Being homeless is hard enough, people have attacked me, slashed my tent and destroyed my chair. 

To anyone reading this, please look after your health. Before my injury I was fit, active and played rugby every Sunday. I felt like nothing would ever stop me. Sadly, that not the case. If you don‚Äôt take care of yourself and aren‚Äôt careful you could do some serious damage and the events that follow can be out of your control. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get comments telling me to ‚Äútoughen up‚Äù but I‚Äôm past that. I‚Äôve made my decision and I won‚Äôt be in pain anymore. 

Edit: Thank you all for your lovely comments. I am still here - I went to hospital but they turned me away. I feel a lot better, but still worried about my legs and my long term health. Please don‚Äôt worry about me, God bless you.

1gdbt27,povertyfinance,I surprised my son with our new place after being homeless for three months and his reaction broke me.,"He couldn't believe it, asked me if it was really ours while I showed him the place and when I said yes he burst into tears, gave me a hug and thanked me. It was gut wrenching to witness him being so emotional and grateful over this tiny, empty space. I feel like such a horrible parent, I don't deserve a pat on the back for providing a basic need that every child deserves from their parent.

Something I wasn't able to provide for THREE whole months and even though I couldn't have predicted the series of unfortunate events that led us to be in the situation, I still blame myself. Don't get me wrong, I am grateful that we were able to get out. Homelessness is very hard especially with a child but we did it.

1ivymob,homeless,How Long Until It's A Crime?,"Trump is horrible:

The federal office that funds housing and other support for homeless people across the country is slated to shrink dramatically, a prospect that advocates warn would make record-high homelessness even worse.

The Office of Community Planning and Development, within the Department of Housing and Urban Development, is slated to lose 84% of its staff, according to a document seen by NPR. That target is the deepest of any office in the agency.

""That proposed cut is massive. And the potential for adverse impact at the community level and at the national level is also massive,"" said Ann Oliva, who spent a decade at HUD and is now CEO at the National Alliance to End Homelessness.

The same office also funds disaster recovery and programs that help local communities build affordable housing.

Overall, Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, an entity known as DOGE and overseen by Elon Musk, plans to reduce HUD's staffing by about half.

The Community Planning and Development office at HUD disburses more than $3.6 billion in federal funding for rental assistance, mental health and substance use treatment, and outreach to try and get those living outside into shelter or housing. It's the ""backbone"" of local communities' response to homelessness, Oliva said, ""in blue states and red states alike.""

Cutting so much staff would mean firing not only people at headquarters in Washington, D.C., but also those in field offices around the country, she said. And that means it would likely take longer to get funding to the thousands of local nonprofits who provide housing and other support.

Cutting so much staff would mean firing not only people at headquarters in Washington, D.C., but also those in field offices around the country, she said. And that means it would likely take longer to get funding to the thousands of local nonprofits who provide housing and other support.

""Grants need to be processed,"" said one HUD employee, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. They said the prospect of major staff cuts, combined with deferred resignations, are a ""huge worry"" that threatens to disrupt work.

So far, HUD has not addressed such concerns in detail.

""HUD is following direction from the administration while also ensuring the department continues to deliver on its critical functions,"" a HUD spokesperson said in a statement. They said that includes the agency's ""mission to serve rural, tribal and urban communities and statutory responsibilities.""

There's concern about whether homelessness funding will be sent out as usual
The Biden administration approved the next wave of homelessness funding in its last days in power in January. The money has not yet been distributed. Advocates say it could be taking longer simply because of the transition to a new administration. But there's also worry that it's more than that.

In late January, the Trump administration issued a memo freezing spending on federal loans and grants. That was rescinded, and then paused in court after a legal challenge, but a federal judge found some funds were still frozen .

A lawsuit challenging the freeze noted that many local nonprofits that partner with federal agencies rely heavily on government funding, and the loss of it could be devastating. In a recent memo , the National Council of Nonprofits said many groups were still having trouble accessing funds, ""causing them to stop programs, furlough employees, and question multi-year budgets.""

""I'm increasingly concerned that money is paused in a way that's illegal,"" said Peggy Bailey, a former senior adviser at HUD who's now with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

She also said this pause, and the proposed staff cuts, appear to be part of a larger push to shrink HUD. Republicans in Congress have proposed major budget cuts for the agency. The conservative agenda laid out by Trump allies in Project 2025 calls for moving some HUD functions to other agencies, states or localities.

Republicans want to change how federal homelessness funding is spent
There's also been growing Republican opposition to the way federal homelessness funding is spent.

Current longtime bipartisan policy prioritizes getting people into housing and then providing support for those who want addiction or mental health treatment. Supporters say it has a proven track record of keeping people off the street.

But Republicans argue that this policy, or what's called Housing First, has actually made homelessness worse.

Project 2025 calls for ending it . The Cicero Institute, a conservative Texas think tank founded by a Trump ally, has been pushing states to require substance abuse and mental health treatment as a condition for federally funded housing. Researchers at the conservative Manhattan Institute recently proposed shifting homelessness funding to a block-grant system, giving states greater control over how to spend it.

Whatever happens, advocate Ann Oliva said this is a crucial time for tackling homelessness. A record number of people in the U.S. struggle to afford rent or mortgage. And she would expect that number to rise if the office in charge of homelessness prevention was effectively gutted.

""Possibly, construction would stop on affordable housing that's already in the pipeline,"" she said. ""Ultimately, I think the risk is that we will see people falling into homelessness even quicker than we've already seen over the last few years.""

We tired, but we got to fight y'all.

1mp4vpw,homeless,How to fix the homeless crisis in America.,"From: Paul Ward 

Date: July 30, 2025

Subject: Proposal for Final Project: Addressing Homelessness and Mental Illness through Community-Based Solutions

               Introductory Discussion

     This memo outlines a proposal for my final project, which will address the very complex issue of homelessness and mental illness. Additionally, I will examine a hypothetical scenario where an executive order mandates the arrest and detention of homeless and mentally ill individuals in long term prisons, which would effectively be stripping them of their freedom due to them being poor and unhoused. My proposed solution, a comprehensive plan to establish therapeutic, self sufficient communities, offers a stark contrast to this Nazi dictator approach. This topic is a strong fit for the assignment as it demands a thorough analysis of a significant societal problem, the development of an innovative and multi faceted solution, and the persuasive articulation of its benefits and feasibility, all while engaging with various criteria areas of the course.

     The situation I've identified, while presented as a hypothetical executive order, mirrors real world challenges and ethical dilemmas surrounding homelessness and mental illness. Across the United States, individuals experiencing homelessness often grapple with co-occurring mental health disorders, creating a vicious cycle that is difficult to break. The idea of incarcerating these poor, maybe mentally ill, addicted, and unhoused individuals, as posited in the executive order, is not only inhumane but also highly ineffective. Such an approach would exacerbate existing problems, strain an already overburdened justice system, and fail to address the root causes of homelessness and mental illness.

    This project that I am proposing will offer solutions to a problem the government won't or can't figure out how to solve. It tackles the issue on how to humanely treat, and solve this issue with homelessness and mental health. The complexity of the problem and the ambitious nature of the proposed solution will allow me to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of policy development, logistical planning, and social impact assessment. 

     Research has shown the need for a compassionate approach while dealing with the unhoused population in society. For instance, a report by the National Alliance to End Homelessness (2023) highlights that chronic homelessness is often intertwined with serious mental illness and substance use disorders, emphasizing the need for integrated support services rather than punishment measures. This data provides helpful resources, and information to address, and fix this issue. For example, a study published in the Journal of Urban Health (Smith & Johnson, 2022) discusses the efficacy of ""Housing First"" models, which prioritize providing stable housing as a foundation for addressing other challenges like mental health. This research is very valuable and important as it offers evidence based alternatives to incarceration, demonstrating that community-based, supportive housing initiatives yield better outcomes for individuals and society. 

      Also, a publication from the American Psychological Association (APA) (Garcia, 2024) on the ethics of involuntary commitment for mental health patients reveals the delicate balance between individual liberty and public safety. While acknowledging extreme cases where intervention is necessary, the APA emphasizes the importance of least restrictive environments and patient autonomy.

The report will analyze the current landscape, present the detailed plan for therapeutic communities, and argue for its feasibility and benefits.

    Finally I will address how to build 20 homeless cities with 15,000 tiny homes in each city to house the unhoused. A thousand homes for staff: medical personnel, social workers, police, firefighters, city workers, psychologists, and therapists. A city that will be self sustained by the homeless that will be staying there. To help run hospitals, stores, parks, utilities, and city jobs. I will also address how to get individuals on ss disability for ones who cannot work. I will also address how to civilly commit individuals who are to mentally unstable or refuse to get off the streets, and into these communities built for them.

To complete this project, I will undertake several distinct tasks:

Research 

I will start researching the laws and red tapes that will be affected by issuing executive orders. Such as, laws that might lead to the incarceration of a vulnerable population. This involves examining existing laws related to involuntary commitment, civil liberties, and the rights of unhoused individuals. I will also look into the historical context of similar policies, such as vagrancy and civil commitment laws, to understand their outcomes. 

Detailed solutions and planning to address the problems.

such as sites to build, people to hire, and ways to get funding for the sites.

Architectural and urban planning.

Research how to build tiny houses, stores, city buildings, hospitals, waste management, and parks. 

Financial Modeling and. FundingAllocation: I will develop a more detailed budget for the construction, operational costs, and ongoing maintenance of these cities. This will involve researching average costs for construction materials, labor, healthcare services, and social programs. I will justify the redirection of state and federal homelessness funding to these new initiatives, possibly exploring other potential funding streams (e.g., grants, public-private partnerships). This is crucial for demonstrating the financial feasibility of the plan. I will leverage economic reports and public policy analyses.

Staffing and employment 

I will further research and apply the appropriate ratio of staff for medical personnel, social workers, city workers, and administration staff. To work in these homeless cities. And how to employ the individuals who are housed in these communities.

I will also develop a more robust plan for the employment of formerly homeless individuals, including details on job training, skill development, and long-term career pathways. This part needs to be highly practical and address potential challenges in integrating residents into the workforce. I will look into workforce development programs and employment statistics.

Health care and hospitalization

I will also address and fix how to legally, and safely get individuals into the homeless cities, and how to civilly commit those who refuse to go, and are to mentally unstable to make that decision themselves. This will include a panel of 5 doctors, 5 psychologists, and 5 therapists, 5 lawyers who will go over cases by case to either commit the individual for two years maximum, or recommend them to a group home that is more suited for the individual. After the two years release the individual back into the community with a case worker, psychologist, Doctor, and therapists who will work with them three times a week to see if they can fully transition back into society, or have to be civilly committed back to a mental health hospital or a group home for another two years. 

Logistics of Population Relocation and Integration: A detailed plan for identifying and relocating homeless individuals to these communities, ensuring it is done ethically and with respect for individual choice where possible. This also includes strategies for managing community dynamics and fostering a sense of belonging among residents. I will research best practices in community organizing and social integration.

Legal compliance with the laws of the land.

A detailed plan for identifying and relocating homeless individuals to these communities, ensuring it is done ethically and with respect for individual choice where possible. This also includes strategies for managing community dynamics and fostering a sense of belonging among residents. I will research best practices in community organizing and social integration.

Human rights 

make sure these plans don't violate the civil liberties, and harm the mentally unstable, and houseless individuals that we are trying to help get off the streets. 

Addressing counterarguments and state red tapes 

I will address and fix any laws or red tape that will hinder any of these projects going forward by hiring lobbyists, a team of lawyers, doctors, psychologists, and therapists to help bypass these problems.

Writing and revisions 

The final stage involves synthesizing all research and analysis into a coherent, persuasive, and well-structured memo. This will include multiple drafts, focusing on clarity, conciseness, and persuasive language.

Here is a proposed timeline for completing the project, aligning with our class schedule:

 Date ‚Ä¢ Task ‚Ä¢ months ‚Ä¢

This will begin the two-year cycle of building new communities until all homeless people are off the streets.

   So, in conclusion I have experience with the homeless, because I have been homeless off and on for the last 15 years or so.

Ask me anything!","UPDATE: Thanks everyone for the great questions! I have to run now but I'll keep checking this throughout the day/evening and am more than happy to keep discussing if anything else comes up. 

\*\*\*

Hi Reddit!

I‚Äôm a journalist (with a PhD in anthropology) who‚Äôs spent the last several years reporting on America‚Äôs worsening crisis of housing insecurity‚Äîspecifically, the growing number of families and individuals who are homeless despite having jobs (in many cases, more than one).

My new book,¬†*There Is No Place for Us: Working and Homeless in America*, comes out this week. It follows five families in Atlanta as they struggle to find stable housing while navigating low-wage work, predatory landlords, a lack of tenant protections, and a system that prioritizes profit over people's basic need for a home.

The book grew out of an article I wrote for¬†*The New Republic*¬†called [‚ÄúThe New American Homeless,‚Äù](https://newrepublic.com/article/154618/new-american-homeless-housing-insecurity-richest-cities) which went viral in 2019. Since then, I‚Äôve been trying to understand how the richest country in the world became a place where even a full-time job no longer guarantees a roof overhead‚Äîand what it would take to change that. A couple of weeks ago,¬†*The New York Times*¬†published a [guest essay](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/opinion/crisis-working-homeless.html?unlocked_article_code=1.1U4.RMtS.Ermxh-P16gDJ) that distills some of my book‚Äôs key arguments.

Ask me anything!

\-¬†Why so many people with full-time jobs are becoming homeless  
\-¬†How U.S. homelessness is misunderstood and miscounted  
\-¬†Why extended-stay motels function as for-profit homeless shelters‚Äîand how people get trapped in them  
\-¬†How a ‚Äústrong‚Äù economy can actually fuel homelessness and housing precarity

\- Why criminalizing homelessness is not only cruel but utterly counterproductive  
\-¬†The pernicious myth of the ""deserving poor""  
\-¬†Atlanta‚Äôs gentrification as a case study for what‚Äôs happening across the country  
\-¬†What we could do‚Äîright now‚Äîto end this crisis  
\-¬†Or anything else about housing, poverty, or the systems that keep people unhoused

1l6ickp,povertyfinance,HELP!! FIRED AND EVICTED IN THE SAME MONTH,"Good afternoon, looking for some advice. 
I am freshly 21 years old. Male
Skilled worker going through hell ‚Äî no job, no home, and nowhere to go with my cats. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.

I‚Äôm not looking for pity or a handout. I‚Äôm just stuck and genuinely don‚Äôt know what to do next. If anyone has advice, experience, or direction, I‚Äôm open to anything realistic right now.

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at:

In the past month, I lost my full-time job, got into a car accident that totaled my vehicle, and got hit with an eviction notice. I‚Äôm still in the apartment for now, but there‚Äôs nothing here but two couches. Everything else is at my moms. Which I‚Äôm not able to go too for multiple reasons. I‚Äôve been applying for jobs and trying to find a place to live, but without proof of income, I can‚Äôt get approved for anything. And I can‚Äôt fake paystubs or anything like that ‚Äî the situation with my former employer is messy, and I‚Äôm not trying to drag that drama out. It‚Äôs complicated and not worth the risk.

I don‚Äôt have a support system to fall back on. I can‚Äôt stay with my mom. Friends either don‚Äôt have space or won‚Äôt allow me to bring my cats.

And that‚Äôs the one thing I won‚Äôt compromise on: I have three cats. They are everything to me. They‚Äôve been with me for years, and they‚Äôve been my only constant through all of this. I know it makes everything harder ‚Äî trust me, I know. But I will not separate from them. I‚Äôm not putting them in a shelter, and I‚Äôm not handing them off. It‚Äôs not up for debate. I‚Äôll sleep in my car before I give them up 
(I‚Äôm in the process of getting a vehicle) 

As for work ‚Äî I‚Äôm skilled. I‚Äôve got four 
years of hands-on experience in plumbing and HVAC. I know electrical. I can install or repair home appliances. If it involves tools, I can probably figure it out. I‚Äôve also worked in retail. I‚Äôll take on anything ‚Äî labor, service, side jobs, under-the-table work, whatever. I just need someone to give me a chance. I‚Äôm willing and able. I want to work. I want to get back on my feet.

But right now I feel stuck in a loop:
No job ‚Üí no apartment ‚Üí no address ‚Üí no job ‚Üí and repeat.

I‚Äôm not looking to be saved. I‚Äôm just asking:
	‚Ä¢	What would you do in this situation?
	‚Ä¢	Are there realistic ways to find pet-friendly housing without proof of income?
	‚Ä¢	Any leads on work where skills matter more than paperwork?
	‚Ä¢	Or any programs/resources that don‚Äôt separate you from your animals?

That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got. I just feel like I‚Äôm running out of options and I‚Äôm trying to keep from slipping into full panic mode.

If you‚Äôve been here ‚Äî or somewhere close ‚Äî and made it out, please tell me how.

Thanks to anyone who reads this.

I‚Äôm a 24 year old man living in Louisiana, and I spent most of my teens and early 20s taking care of my disabled parents, at the cost of college and career. I do have a record of employment, but it‚Äôs spotty; nothing over a year at any one place. Over the last few years it was doable‚Äî my parents could make ends meet with SSI/SSDI and I would cook, clean, go to the grocery etc‚Äî but my mom passed right before the new year, and my dad passed last week. 


I wasn‚Äôt aware until after my mom passed that she had fallen behind pretty severely on rent, and my landlord has been incredibly gracious, but the situation at hand is I have to move out by march 1 to avoid eviction proceedings and/or an obligation for my mom‚Äôs debt. I‚Äôve been looking around desperately since before my dad passed, and nobody has a couch for me; none of my friends, my grandparents, my godparents(who both live in different states). Essentially I can live out of my mom‚Äôs car, hang out at the library during the day, sleep in Walmart parking lots at night, until the car is repossessed. That probably gives me an extra month. 

Cremation costs for both my parents have totally kneecapped me, and I have just enough money left to afford an Amtrak ticket or a one-way flight, plus a few hundred to put myself up in a shared room for about a month. Southeast Louisiana is a really, REALLY bad place to be homeless, and the minimum wage is still 7.25 here. All the places I‚Äôve looked out-of-state want a minimum 250/week, and I need proof of income 2x the weekly rate. Do I have ANY options? Is there some boat job in Alaska that I could fit into? Is there some Americorps-type volunteer gig that‚Äôll give me lodging? Is the couchsurfing app reliable? I don‚Äôt qualify for military service so that isn‚Äôt really an option right now, either. 


I‚Äôm just kind of at my wit‚Äôs end, and I‚Äôm willing to keep my head down and move forward with my life, even if it‚Äôs not a dream job in an awesome state, but I don‚Äôt know where to go or how to go.

I‚Äôm not treating my tumor anymore because it‚Äôs not cancerous it‚Äôs just a hormone secreting tumor. I‚Äôm not dealing with my chronic joint pain because I can‚Äôt afford physical therapy nor do I have anywhere to reliably go to do it. 

My car payment is $320 a month. Yes it‚Äôs high but to get to work I need a car and again, I‚Äôm $5000 underwater. 

I could rent a room but those around my job are about $1000 or more because my job is downtown. I still can‚Äôt get rid of the car but I wouldn‚Äôt need to drive it to work if I‚Äôm downtown. I‚Äôd just need for appointments and errands. 

Again I‚Äôm only earning $850 biweekly and I‚Äôve tried getting referrals to jobs and applying directly to website and going to job fairs and I don‚Äôt have a higher paying job yet. I‚Äôm losing faith because I‚Äôm putting in a lot of work and all I‚Äôve gotten out of it is pizza delivering. 

Which option would you take in my situation? I don‚Äôt have any close family or friends. Nobody at work is renting a room. I can‚Äôt carpool because I don‚Äôt live near any coworkers and we all have different schedules. 

I‚Äôm living with my parents and my dad‚Äôs evicting me because I don‚Äôt follow his rules (personal items in the bathroom, if he puts something in the hallway I need to take it out of the hallway, if he tells me to open a window I need to open the window, etc. I was told I‚Äôm not allowed to have different ideas in his house)

Yes I‚Äôm an adult. I‚Äôm 29. I have poor credit and lots of debt, $120k+ of debt and an eviction from a series of mental health hospitalizations. 

I have no one to co-sign anything for me. No guarantor. It‚Äôs just me doing this. I‚Äôm already working with social services and this is what they‚Äôve been able to help me with so far. I could go to a shelter but to keep my job, I have to work night shifts from home as a requirement. I work at varying times of the day during the week so I only have the weekends free to work.

1k32dup,povertyfinance,Does Anyone Find It Frustrating That Most People Don't Understand How Expensive Rent Really Is?,"I'm 33. I spent most of my 20s making $7.50 an hour in near poverty. Now I have a good job (Systems Admin) in a good career field with a Master of Science degree. However, I only make $42K a year before tax. 

A lot of people tell me, if you are unhappy where you are living, ""MOVE!"" but I literally can't afford rent anywhere in the country. Not even in the middle of nowhere Iowa or Nebraska or Wyoming. 

Just about everywhere I have looked in the US the cheapest rents are about $1000 a month even before utilities and even checking SpareRoom, Roommates, etc. Most people want a minimum of $1000 to be there roommate or rent a 200 square foot room. People have even given me the suggestion of renting a trailer somewhere. Same thing, every mobile home I have seen starts at around $1000 just for the rent before the lot fees + utilities. 

People tell me to stop looking at NYC or LA or Boston. But I am not. I'm looking at rural and suburban towns in the middle of nowhere. 

Then further more, the rare time a place pops up for $800 or so a month. The landlord wants a minimum income level of around $50K to $60K a year to even be considered. I just can't seem to win.

About 4 years ago, I had a two bad employers that wouldn't pay me and I ended up in a ton of credit card debt. I've spent the last two years paying off all of the debt. Just made my last payment yesterday. 

I'm hoping to save most of my income and maybe find a better job (the market is slow, so it may be awhile). But even then it seems like even people are listing their single wides at $300K that need a lot of work and they are selling! As where true 800 square foot one story homes go for $400K in the middle of nowhere.

I get the fact that people are trying to be helpful. I think most of them are homeowers with combined incomes that have fixed rate mortgages that only cost them $1000 a month. They probably still think rent is $500 a month for a 1 bed room.

1kg18lp,povertyfinance,Stuck in a shelter with just my phone and Wi-Fi ‚Äî how would you escape this situation?,"Hey everyone, I really need some advice or even just a plan.

In August 2024, I lost my job. I sold my Xbox and a few other things just to cover rent and food. By the end of November, my family basically gave up on me ‚Äî they arranged an Uber, dropped me off at a shelter in the middle of nowhere (the nearest town is 12 miles away), and that was that.

1mjdar0,povertyfinance,I got harassed by a cop this morning for sleeping in my car‚Äîeven though I was legally parked.,"This morning around 7 a.m., I was asleep in my car in a legal parking area in Florida. I have a clean, newer car with tinted windows and a windshield cover. I don‚Äôt leave trash or make noise. I‚Äôm a woman sleeping alone, trying to stay safe.

A cop knocked on my window and looked at me with absolute disgust. He said, ‚ÄúYou cannot be sleeping in your car,‚Äù in a tone that made me feel like I was doing something dirty or criminal.

And I just want to ask‚Äîwhat do they expect me to do instead? Go sleep on the sidewalk? On the floor where there‚Äôs garbage and animal feces? Would that be more acceptable? This is terrible.

I‚Äôm upset. Sleeping in your car isn‚Äôt illegal in Florida if you‚Äôre legally parked‚Äîand I was. But beyond legality, what‚Äôs broken is the way people in power treat you. I wasn‚Äôt harming anyone. I was surviving. Quietly. Cleanly.

I shower every day. I keep my car spotless. I have a job. I make sure no one can even tell I sleep in my car. And still, I get treated like trash. Like I‚Äôm some kind of threat‚Äîjust for existing in a way that doesn‚Äôt make people comfortable.

The system says shelters are the solution‚Äîbut we all know many of them are unsafe, overcrowded, or simply unavailable. For a woman, especially, sleeping in a locked car is far safer than sleeping in a shelter where you risk harassment or worse.

So I‚Äôm asking honestly: What‚Äôs the point of a law that criminalizes the safest option some people have? Why does survival have to come with so much shame?

Has anyone else experienced this? How do you handle it?

1msk4zj,povertyfinance,Well fuck me. Deferred from donating plasma for a year,"Two steps forward, three steps back. I finally felt like I was making some progress and then I get knocked on my ass again. Finally have a stable budget and income, promotion at work should be enough to break even, biggest pain in the ass right now is CC debt. I made a lot of stupid decisions 18-22, including letting a long term girlfriend ""borrow"" somewhere in the ballpark of $5k from me (I know, I know. it's a hard lesson I'll be carrying probably for the rest of my life) as well as a roughly 9 month span of homeless/housing insecurity when I was 19, so now I'm trudging through paying off a ~$11,800 credit card balance. I've been trying to put $300 towards it every month (minimum payment is around $240) which I've largely been earning through donating my plasma. 

After the new donor bonus ran up, I was getting about $100/week. So $300 towards the credit card and $100 to save, not terrible, but something. I took out student loans and got a degree double majoring in two things that pay like shit without a graduate degree (psych and envsci) because I wanted to study things I was passionate about, now I make $17/hr working full time as a park ranger. I'm in need-based deferment on my loans right now. My primary goal while I'm not making payments is to figure out a way to make more money. I'm no longer accumulating any additional cc debt aside from interest thankfully, I'm on food stamps and Medicaid. 

So everything was going ok, I was saving a tiny bit each month, I was making little dents in the credit card balance (my credit score is 712 somefuckinghow, maybe because I've never missed a payment, last year before I had to pay for a $2k medical bill with it my score was inching towards 750), and then a fucking bat got into my house. I have no idea how long the little bastard was in here for, but we caught it and had animal control collect it for testing. Guess what...rabies positive. Health department ordered we all get post exposure shots. I had donated plasma the day before, so I called the office just in case I had just sent over rabies-infected blood. I was informed after completing the PEP I will not be able to donate for the next 12 months to ensure I do not have the rabies virus in my system. Totally fair. But...that missing $400 is going to fucking suck. I'm so mad. 

I'm 23, I'm renting a place with 3 roommates, I have a car with a loan I'm on track to pay off in 4 years but with high enough mileage that I really don't want to get back into doordash. I know I got myself into this situation and made a lot of stupid choices. I'm just trying to figure out the best way forward. The promotion I just got might be enough to cover the difference, but it's tight. I wish I had picked a different major, or that I never met my ex and gave her all of that money, or that I never needed to have that surgery that ate up so much of my savings, or that I hadn't been kicked out of the house as a teenager. Coulda-shoulda-woulda, I don't want people to call me a dumbass because I already know. I don't want to get a job doing something I don't really care about because I do genuinely want to keep working in the outdoors, just something that will pay me better. I wish I'd had less shit going on in school so I could've talked and thought about this more, but I was so focused on just trying to survive and not drop out that I didn't think about what happens next. I just don't want this degree of stress and suffering to be my life forever.

1ngx01e,homeless,Been homeless for years here is my advise/what i have learned from my views,"Lol iv been homeless probably 60% my life (started at like 13 and im 31 now) of course iv had bits of being in houses ect however somethings iv learned over the years i wanna share so im posting this for new homelessness humans not asking for money just giving advise (idk why AI is suggesting i am asking for money silly robot) 

(Disclaimer not everything here suggested is 100% legal im not saying everything is the best route to take or best action im just saying iv done it iv lived reasearch the laws to your area while im good with law i am not a lawyer)  also leads me to a new tip, LEARN LAWS AND YOUR RIGHTS WHILE BEING HOMELESS

Now for those who dont drive and dont like where you are and wanna escape

-hitchhiking- it can be super fun, interesting way to meet people/get jobs/money ect iv managed to hitch hike aus, canada, NZ, US, mexico, parts of europe only 2 bad exp and only 1 of those was actually bad bad where i had to put someones car into a ditch for not letting me out of the car at my destination (cops arrested him he got charged with 2 seperate murders of hitchhikers so ya kinda sketchy) however iv seen some the coolest shit hitchhiking other side coin you may get some super religious people

-trainhopping- super dangerous altho thrilling and you see parts of country youd never see hitchhiking

-rideshares- i hate em absolutely always let me down do not reccomend 

*those with wheels* 
Drive where you wanna go, panhandle truckstops for gas write a sign says ""traveling broke need gas and or a job"" you will get gas and or a job for day to get gas 

*Sleeping spots* 

Holidays - ie christmas sleep in a bank trust me iv wokem up with enough money to rent apartments in past but doesnt always work

Campgrounds- by far my favorite spot to hit up i normally go in at dark and out super early i havent paid to camp in years even in provincial parks make sure you do have cash to cover spot incase they show up later then like 830pm 

Sides of roads in cubbys- can be profitable however business's will probably call cops but if you ask for a broom/window cleaner and help maintain the spot most wont care however your exposed to people and well they are unpredicible

Parks- tenting in a park is well in my exp terrible you are gonna get woken up 100% 

Tent citys - just stay away if your sober you wont be long if you stay regardless what you think takes getting drunk once to say yes just dont go unless your already in active addiction lots cops, lots thiefts and stabbings/murders ect (google invincible green surrey BC) i actually knew this giy in real life, before i found out he was a rapist however that being said he was sober until he went to a tent city now hes doing time in jail for murdering someone with a crossbow + the rape of a minor from like 10 years before

*Panhandling* 

Panhandle medians 100% more profitable then sitting in a bar district 

*Quick jobs* 

picking fruit- okanogan BC canada every spring-fall is screaming for pickers if you do it right and party off the quebecers that love to party (of course contribute when you can to the party if they are hurting) you can live in a inclusive hotel in mexico for winter (ice grapes are best profit) 

Picking flowers- east coast canada lots of flower farms also need pickers imo doesnt pay as well as fruit 

Busking- if you play, i suggest doing it in bar districts be prepared to play wonderwall on repeat basically (i have a sign says wonderwall is a 20 dollar request)lol 

Temp labour - i hate these but they are a nessisary evil that can result in full time work 

Shelters/drop ins/gyms

Some shelters mostly small town are great once your in city things can go well or terrible depends on shelter/drop in 

Personally i got a gym membership so i can shower i try to avoid shelters/drop ins i just dont like the vibes of them personally but they help lots people and have good resources however if you are youth ie 14-24 your shelters are better then those of us who have aged out

Pets 

I have a dog, 2 cats im currently homeless with i work full time as well they have there plus sides (not so much the cats) and major downsides

Pros-
-Your gonna know if someones stealing fRom you  
-You always have something when you feel like giving up 
-They always love you 

Cons
-If you dont got a car/truck/RV good luck getting out of the weather, shelters normally wont take you the emergancy cold shelters some of them will 
-Costs money to have them but people will give you endless food for them like endless 
-SPCA/bylaw some citys will take your animal if your homeless regardless how well you care for them always search bylaws and gtfo of towns that will apprehend them with out question

Sleeping arrangements 
I hate tents imma tell you with 100% that hammock has been best bed i ever had when i didnt have a wheels they are lighter, not as bulky 

Eating
Panning most resteraunts will get you food personally i like to cook my own i got 2 burner stove and carry charcoal (again i drive so find something that suites your needs) some use hiking stoves 

The groups of people you wanna chill with
So im always gonna go look for the folk punks like 100% and even that crowd can be hit and miss but 95% of them are super welcoming and inclusive of everyone but theres bad eggs in all crowds ie jesse stewart before he died (miss you arlo(his dog was a gem) 

Also females please for love of god be careful way to many things happen to you all no matter what croud you are in please be cautious of fkn everyone i mean everyone esspecially if you are a people pleaser that struggles saying no to people carry a knife or if american in a place you can carry please fkn carry something a 22 handgun is better then nothing i promise you this so many women i know beem assulted amd many have kids from it and its absolutely heart breaking

If i missed something probably have feel free to comment questions/message whatever i will answer them im pretty good at finding resources ",43,0.91,14,2025-09-14 13:16:32,thesunonecsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/1ngx01e/been_homeless_for_years_here_is_my_advisewhat_i/,True,search,593.7536285575,0.32558139534883723,0.07242061005078274,0.1008608117650671,0.5687242869423719,6072,1123

1gtugde,urbancarliving,Homeless vs houseless,"It seems a lot of people don't understand the difference. In my opinion, you can be houseless and not homeless. [Home is of, relating to, or being a place of residence, place of origin, or base of operations] so that does not mean a physical house. It can be a physical house, but essentially, it is where you live, whether you choose to or not. Some people choose to live in their car.... that makes it their home. If you choose to live in a shed, that is your home.... tent/box, etc. Wherever you reside is your home. In theory, no one is ever really homeless; they are just houseless. Yeah, I might be getting technical, but I think it's important to understand the difference because sometimes those little details matter. Telling yourself that you're homeless when you don't have a physical house can take a toll on mental health. If you understand that you always have a home but are temporarily houseless, it doesn't hit as hard. This is all in my own opinion, anyways. I have been houseless many times, and I've even been forced onto the streets but have also chosen a few times to live that lifestyle to save money or relieve the stress of bills and rent.",6,0.56,81,2024-11-17 21:28:18,gamestocks87,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbancarliving/comments/1gtugde/homeless_vs_houseless/,True,search,7809.557798418334,13.5,0.0007682893391499295,0.026126893939393936,0.4378869047619047,1186,215
1jj51gw,homeless,My 3 pillars philosophy,"Feel like this is best measurement of determining likelihood of becoming homeless or staying homeless. 

You have 3 support structures holding it and maintaining you as a housed contributing member of society. Bad things can happen to anyone, so you can likely teeter totter on two pillars if one falls, but safe to assume if you lose 2, you will not be able to maintain life on just one pillar.

Employment (or financial safety)
Vehicle (or public transportation if in major metro)
Housing

You can lose your job, but if you have central place for stuff and able to get about you can side hustle money, get to interviews. But add losing the car, can‚Äôt maintain house and Vice versus. 

Job and car easiest pairing to get out of homelessness

Home and car most worrying

1j944ff,urbancarliving,Tampa sos 1987 camry water pump,"EDIT: 1997 Toyota Camry

Me, my bf and 2 cats are stranded right over the causeway in tampa, and my strongest belief is the water pump as it sounds like a gurgling/rattle that progressively got worse. At this point, it's just pouring water out of the weep hole as I fill the radiator.

I'm close to taking the timing belt off, and I noticed that the sprockets and the markers aren't aligned up and I don't don't want to do now, I'm still researching and it's taking too long and if I have to rush it I'm worried about messing up since I don't understand why its not aligned. We've been here 2 days now and it was very cold last night. We will owe it to anyone who can help with steps or coming out to help. I can do $100 if you give me like 2 weeks maybe even less, I'm a very honest person and don't try to screw people over for no reason as it has happened to me too many times and i felt unbelievable hurt. Or whatever you think is reasonable. I already have most of it off, and my hands are small, so it's easier to work in the small space.

I don't think I have the right stuff to unscrew the crank pully and we are working with $30 which were really trying not to spend on anything yet because we need gas to work and we shouldn't even be in tampa right now because we missed our exit in St Petersburg to stop at an auto store there before the car started to overheat again. Now, it won't drive at all without overheating in like 4 minutes.

UPDATE: Someone helped me realize that it wasn't aligned because I didn't go through enough rotations. Now I'm somewhere too far from a walmart to make it before they close to get a breaker bar to bump the crank and get the bolt off. If anyone has one and come help with just this, I should be good. Honestly, this spot might be good for a night of sleep, too, as we were parked here overnight fixing this. Noisy road, but no tow away signs or anything!

UPDATE 2: I tried to use my medium sized ratchet with the 19mm socket on a pole extender to do the starter bump method on their harmonizer. The ratchet lock popped inside the ratchet, so now the sockets don't fit and that's a first for me. No more leads on what to do now and we're feeling extremely miserable at this point. What can I do with $30 idkk

UPDATE 3: 4:35am I had couple more ideas I could try to support the harmonizor to take it off, but failed and gave up and had to sleep.
10:00am. We were freezing all morning, we're going crazy, a series of unfortunate events that keeps happening to us and had done all we can given our circumstances..

I found solice in cooking and cleaning and moving around what felt like a private living space freely. Being in the car my head is constantly on a swivel, to stand up and stretch I have to get out and the only hint of privacy is in a bathroom or the changing rooms in my gym, I feel like I'm constantly being surveilled no matter where I park, I feel like any person or car is a threat, and I'm falling apart at the seams. An option people kept trying to throw at me was going back to the original state I moved from and living in my abusive/rodent infested family home, but I kept pushing it away, expressing heavily that I am in a rocky mental state due to that home and those parents that say they love me and express it so toxicly. I guess what I'm trying to ask is if that father in that home is still naming me on his insurance and using it I made an appointment with the psychiatrist on talkspace and was prescribed the medication again but only in the state they live in, what should I do? Because I think I could get a job soon, but the options for jobs right now are currently limited, and some don't offer any insurance and the ones that might have a wait time before it kicks in and even so the insurance may not cover what my father's covers and I'm scared that the only way to get the meds to get a better psyche while living in this car would be to live back there in the place that is the reason I'm talking the meds to begin with.

EDIT: Additional information:

I work 28 a week. That's the most my employer will give me. I don't drive, don't have a license, so 28 at 18/hr is probably about the best I can do. (The 4000/1500 numbers were after taxes, so it's 80% of what the math says.) If I absolutely need to supplement that, I'll find something to do the other 12.

We'll apply for unemployment in the morning; he's torn to pieces right now. I'll make sure he gets a letter. We live in Grand Rapids, MI.

We were living in a 3-bed with the third, who we took in a year ago when she lost her job, but now she wants to move out. She says I make her feel like shit and I can't dispute it. She did not contribute financially. I would really like to find a 1-bed and downsize as much as I can but I don't know how finding housing is going to work until we get back on our feet.

1mieu4m,povertyfinance,My wife and I are nearly $200k in debt and don‚Äôt know what to do. We‚Äôre asking for help or advice from anyone who‚Äôs been here.,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm honestly not the type to put my personal life out on the internet, but I‚Äôm at a point where I don‚Äôt know where else to turn. My wife and I are in nearly $200,000 of debt and we‚Äôre drowning. I‚Äôve read some posts on here that gave me a bit of hope, so I figured maybe if I shared our story, someone might have some advice or point us in a direction we haven‚Äôt thought of.

Our situation:

We‚Äôre both in our early 30s. No kids yet. We‚Äôve been together since college, always tried to be responsible, and thought we were making smart choices. But over the last several years, things have piled up. Now it‚Äôs just become this massive mountain we can‚Äôt seem to get in front of.

Here‚Äôs what our debt looks like:
	‚Ä¢	Credit cards: about $38,000 across four cards, most of them with really high interest rates
	‚Ä¢	Personal loans: $26,000, mostly taken to consolidate old debt, which clearly didn‚Äôt work
	‚Ä¢	Auto loans: $31,000 combined for two cars, one is still upside-down
	‚Ä¢	Student loans: $70,000 total between the two of us
	‚Ä¢	Medical bills and miscellaneous stuff: $5,000
	‚Ä¢	IRS debt: $6,000 from back taxes during the pandemic when we were both underemployed

We‚Äôre currently making about $110,000 a year combined. We rent, live in a medium cost of living area, and try to cut every expense we can. We don‚Äôt eat out, we canceled all subscriptions except the bare minimum, and we‚Äôve already sold a bunch of stuff. But we‚Äôre still falling behind.

How it got this bad:

It wasn‚Äôt one big decision, it was a slow buildup. My wife lost her job during COVID. I had my hours cut. We lived off credit cards for a while, thinking things would turn around soon. Then her mom got sick and passed, and we helped out financially with some of the medical and funeral costs. I know people say not to go into debt for family, but when it‚Äôs someone you love, it doesn‚Äôt feel like a choice at the time.

We took out personal loans to try to clean up the credit card mess, but then we fell behind on those too. One step forward, two steps back. Now we‚Äôre paying hundreds in minimum payments every month and the balances barely move because the interest is so high.

We‚Äôve looked into options, but everything feels confusing or risky. I don‚Äôt want to get scammed or make things worse.

What we‚Äôre asking:

If anyone has been in a similar place, how did you get out? What actually works? We‚Äôre open to anything at this point.

We‚Äôve looked into:

‚Ä¢ Credit counseling
‚Ä¢ Debt management programs
‚Ä¢ Debt settlement
‚Ä¢ Bankruptcy (which honestly scares the hell out of us)
‚Ä¢ Refinancing our auto loans
‚Ä¢ Trying the snowball or avalanche method, which we‚Äôre currently doing, but progress is slow

We‚Äôd love to hear real experiences. The good, the bad, anything. If you used a legit service or nonprofit organization that helped, please let us know. If you filed for bankruptcy and it worked out, or didn‚Äôt, I‚Äôd like to hear that too.

Even if you just have some encouragement or a reality check, I‚Äôm open to it. I‚Äôm trying to be honest with myself and with the situation. We‚Äôre not lazy. We‚Äôre not irresponsible. But we are in over our heads and just trying to survive right now.

Thanks for reading this and taking the time. I know it‚Äôs a mess.

1nckra6,povertyfinance,PSA to Anyone Struggling with Food Insecurity!,"PLEASE USE LOCAL FOOD BANKS. 

You can use food banks even if you already have food at home. You can use food banks even if you have money to buy food. You can use food banks even if you are only temporarily struggling financially. You can use food banks even if you aren't on the verge of starvation. You can use food banks even if you have a car. You can use food banks even if you have nice things. You can use food banks even if you are employed. You can use food banks even if you are unemployed. You can use food banks even if you are eligible or already receieving government aid.

The use of food banks is heavily stigmatized and misunderstood. Not wanting to use one out of the belief that you don't truly need it, so that the people who do can have access to the resources they need, is perfectly understandable and admirable. But understanding when you need it is the part that some struggle with as it is often stigmatized as a personal failure or only for people who are in extreme poverty. Food banks are there to help anyone, and they receive funding based on the number of people who use the service. So by not utilizing this resource, you are only setting yourself back as well as not allowing the food bank to give an accurate figure to report to receive funding. 

Food banks help fill the nutritional gaps in you diet, as well as providing food that you may not have access to, meaning it is okay to use them even if you already have food at home. Just because you have rice and potatoes at home, does not mean you can't go to pick up a protein source and some vegetables/fruits to supplement your diet. 

Food banks are there to help you free up money in your budget, so that you don't have to pick and choose which bills to pay or fall behind on something just to eat. You do not need to neglect getting maintenance work done on your car or getting your healthcare needs met, so that you can afford food. It is okay to go even if you technically have money in your account to buy food, but that money could help you out significanlty if it went elsewhere.

Food banks are the perfect option for those who are only temporarily struggling as they require less commitment than applying for social services. They are there to help bridge the gap needed during financial hardships due to any cause. You do not need a good enough reason in order to go. 

Food banks are there so that people do not go hungry, as no one should know what that feels like. Even if you aren't on the verge of starvation or extreme nutritional deficits, you should still go as you deserve a warm, satisfying meal to look forward to each day. 

Food banks are great for those who don't have access to transportation or nearby grocery stores, but that doesn't mean you can't use one if you have a car. Sometimes, access to a car is all you have and it will only help you bring your food home easier. You do not need to sell your car or any of your possessions first, before you consider going to a food bank. People can go through extreme financial changes in only a short period of time, and the food bank is there to help. If you really want, you can offer to give someone a ride home at the food bank who had to walk there. 

No matter whether you are employed or unemployed, the food bank is there so that you do not have to go without food as no one deserves to suffer in that way. Whether you need the energy for work, or applying to jobs and attending interviews, your body and your health matters and the food bank is there to help you meet your needs. 

Government aid does not always meet everyone's needs, especially with the ongoing changes happening and restrictions on what you are allowed to buy. So even if you are already receiving help, it is okay to go to the food bank to cover the gaps. That is exactly what it is intended to do.

If you are still uncomfortable with the idea of utilizing a food bank, you can always pay it forward. You can use it now when you need it, and donate or volunteer to one when you are in a better position. 

I wish you all the best <3 and please utilize your local library for more help as they can provide information on local resources, help you apply for government assistance, and many even provide free seeds to grow your own food.

1nnryuw,povertyfinance,Army won't let me enlist because I've been in an mental institution?,"I posted on here before and got great advice. I've been trying everything. I talked to a recruiter for about a month, but I don't know what to do anymore. I passed PT assessments. I did the MEPS process and signed the contract. I was supposed to be leaving out for basic training on the 26th. I didn't know anything about the mental health guidelines for the military, and I guess they did the background and found out I admitted and stayed in a mental hospital for 10 days. I did, of course. But I did it at a time I most wanted to kill myself.

I'm not eating every day and losing weight. My mom passed away, and I got left alone with the house and lost it. I was working but quit when I got further along in the recruitment process. I thought it was a sure thing.  But I did all of that just for them to ring this up at the last second. And they told me I can't leave out now. I'm trying to escape homelessness, starvation, and depression. This was my only way out, and I'm devastated because I made friends and people who cared that I was supposed to join with. Now I'm stuck back here. With a car that needs an altenator. I can't even move it, and it's the only thing I have. I use it to sleep in. I dropped my classes also, and I truly have nothing going for me. I'm 19 and got hit with this life shit pretty early. I miss my mom so much.

I'm in this car that I can't move, I don't have any friends or family to fall back on right now. Idec about eating anymore. My plan for elevating my life went to shit.

1lr56o3,povertyfinance,How I escaped generational poverty.,"I guess this post is more for the younger crowd but this is how I escaped poverty and hope it will help someone else.

My parents both worked min wage jobs.
We lived paycheck to Tuesday with nothing. 
Their parents were single moms also working in service industry. Dad's were not around. Yes I grew up in a trailer park.

I started working retail at 16. I worked my way up to shift Manger then assistant. I always volunteered to work extra and go the extra mile. By the time I was 25, I was a store manager for smallish sized clothing company with about 200 stores. At the time making $45k. Which was really good money. The year was about 2010 for reference. My mother passed away a year later and I had nothing tying me down here. I was renting a room in an apartment. 

I was later recruited to large retsiler and given a solid offer $75k that also provided a relocation. I was put in a shit store but worked the location and met our metrics. I also moved two states away and a different time zone. This was about 2019.

I was recruited again to a competitor so to speak and now work in the HR/Benefits world. I did start at a lower position but they matched my pay. I have now worked up to a specific position that requires certifications. I make $125k plus bonus. My employer paid for certificates.

That's how I escaped. It wasn't glorious. I worked a ton of nights weekends and holidays. I missed functions, events, and so forth. 

But I'm 38 now. 
Married, own my home, we have an awesome son and a 401k that is well funded. My son will never have to endure my struggles but he is being taught the value of a dollar. I work fully remote, m-f. Hours vary, as my function is more task driven. My wife is a stay at home mother.

So the answer is retail, sacrifice 20 years of a life and move around. Not the best answer but it worked for me. And I only have a high school diploma. I also believe I will end my generational poverty.",1751,0.96,188,2025-07-03 20:23:10,Majestic-Mulberry-18,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1lr56o3/how_i_escaped_generational_poverty/,True,search,2338.6457738047225,0.10736721873215306,0.7487239066356395,0.19987734487734488,0.3930339105339106,1972,375

1m0p17x,povertyfinance,If you‚Äôre struggling to afford dental work go to Mexico,"Just wanted to share my experience in case it helps someone here. I live in Los Angeles, and dental care here is insanely expensive even with insurance. I couldn‚Äôt afford the dental work I needed, so after reading a few posts on Reddit, I decided to try getting dental care in Los Algodones, Mexico. It‚Äôs a small town right across the border from Yuma, Arizona. Algodones is often referred to as ‚ÄúThe Molar Capital of the World‚Äù due to the high number of dental clinics concentrated in the town.

Since then, I‚Äôve had a sinus lift, two implants, deep cleanings, regular cleanings,root canals, crowns, extractions, fillings, and Zoom whitening. The quality of care has been great. My sister‚Äôs come with me and has had an implant, bone graft, root canals, wisdom teeth removal, crowns, and fillings. 

We‚Äôve saved thousands getting our dental work done in Mexico. The dentists we‚Äôve seen have been professional, kind, and didn‚Äôt try to upsell anything. The clinics are clean and modern. If you stay in Yuma, some clinics even offer free shuttles to and from the border, which makes the trip really easy.

It‚Äôs not for everyone. You‚Äôll need a passport, and you‚Äôll have to do your homework but if dental care feels out of reach financially, this could be a legit option.
