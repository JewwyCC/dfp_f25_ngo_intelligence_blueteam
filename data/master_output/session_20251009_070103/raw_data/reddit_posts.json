    "selftext":"\n\nHey everyone,\n\n\nI\u2019ve posted here before, I am from the UK and I\u2019m homeless and have been for a year. Two years ago I fell out of a lorry and snapped my ankle on the curb. I caused permanent damage to leg and couldn\u2019t walk for 10 months. I was only getting government sick pay and it didn\u2019t cover my rent. After 12 months I was evicted, by that time I could walk but I\u2019ve had a limp ever since and have to use a walking stick. The local council say they don\u2019t have a \u201cduty of care\u201d as I\u2019m not in a wheelchair. So for the last 12 months I\u2019ve been living in the fucking forest. \n\nSadly I\u2019ve realised this week I won\u2019t ever get better as the pain that has been radiating up my left leg has now moved over to my right leg. The doctor has explained it\u2019s moved into my hips. I\u2019m fucking 28. I\u2019m not doing this anymore! I\u2019m in constant pain and no pain killers work. Every step I take I\u2019m in pain, I have no family and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever work again. I\u2019m useless and poor so I will be ending it tonight at 22:00 at my favourite oak tree. \n\nBeing homeless is hard enough, people have attacked me, slashed my tent and destroyed my chair. \n\nTo anyone reading this, please look after your health. Before my injury I was fit, active and played rugby every Sunday. I felt like nothing would ever stop me. Sadly, that not the case. If you don\u2019t take care of yourself and aren\u2019t careful you could do some serious damage and the events that follow can be out of your control. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get comments telling me to \u201ctoughen up\u201d but I\u2019m past that. I\u2019ve made my decision and I won\u2019t be in pain anymore. \n\nEdit: Thank you all for your lovely comments. I am still here - I went to hospital but they turned me away. I feel a lot better, but still worried about my legs and my long term health. Please don\u2019t worry about me, God bless you. \n\nLewis. ",

That target is the deepest of any office in the agency.\n\n\"That proposed cut is massive. And the potential for adverse impact at the community level and at the national level is also massive,\" said Ann Oliva, who spent a decade at HUD and is now CEO at the National Alliance to End Homelessness.\n\nThe same office also funds disaster recovery and programs that help local communities build affordable housing.\n\nOverall, Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, an entity known as DOGE and overseen by Elon Musk, plans to reduce HUD's staffing by about half.\n\nThe Community Planning and Development office at HUD disburses more than $3.6 billion in federal funding for rental assistance, mental health and substance use treatment, and outreach to try and get those living outside into shelter or housing. It's the \"backbone\" of local communities' response to homelessness, Oliva said, \"in blue states and red states alike.\"\n\nCutting so much staff would mean firing not only people at headquarters in Washington, D.C., but also those in field offices around the country, she said. And that means it would likely take longer to get funding to the thousands of local nonprofits who provide housing and other support.\n\nThe Community Planning and Development office at HUD disburses more than $3.6 billion in federal funding for rental assistance, mental health and substance use treatment, and outreach to try and get those living outside into shelter or housing.

And that means it would likely take longer to get funding to the thousands of local nonprofits who provide housing and other support.\n\n\"Grants need to be processed,\" said one HUD employee, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. They said the prospect of major staff cuts, combined with deferred resignations, are a \"huge worry\" that threatens to disrupt work.\n\nSo far, HUD has not addressed such concerns in detail.\n\n\"HUD is following direction from the administration while also ensuring the department continues to deliver on its critical functions,\" a HUD spokesperson said in a statement. They said that includes the agency's \"mission to serve rural, tribal and urban communities and statutory responsibilities.\"\n\nThere's concern about whether homelessness funding will be sent out as usual\nThe Biden administration approved the next wave of homelessness funding in its last days in power in January. The money has not yet been distributed. Advocates say it could be taking longer simply because of the transition to a new administration. But there's also worry that it's more than that.\n\nIn late January, the Trump administration issued a memo freezing spending on federal loans and grants. That was rescinded, and then paused in court after a legal challenge, but a federal judge found some funds were still frozen .\n\nA lawsuit challenging the freeze noted that many local nonprofits that partner with federal agencies rely heavily on government funding, and the loss of it could be devastating. In a recent memo , the National Council of Nonprofits said many groups were still having trouble accessing funds, \"causing them to stop programs, furlough employees, and question multi-year budgets.\"\n\n\"I'm increasingly concerned that money is paused in a way that's illegal,\" said Peggy Bailey, a former senior adviser at HUD who's now with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nShe also said this pause, and the proposed staff cuts, appear to be part of a larger push to shrink HUD. Republicans in Congress have proposed major budget cuts for the agency. The conservative agenda laid out by Trump allies in Project 2025 calls for moving some HUD functions to other agencies, states or localities.\n\nRepublicans want to change how federal homelessness funding is spent\nThere's also been growing Republican opposition to the way federal homelessness funding is spent.\n\nCurrent longtime bipartisan policy prioritizes getting people into housing and then providing support for those who want addiction or mental health treatment. Supporters say it has a proven track record of keeping people off the street.\n\nBut Republicans argue that this policy, or what's called Housing First, has actually made homelessness worse.\n\nProject 2025 calls for ending it . The Cicero Institute, a conservative Texas think tank founded by a Trump ally, has been pushing states to require substance abuse and mental health treatment as a condition for federally funded housing. Researchers at the conservative Manhattan Institute recently proposed shifting homelessness funding to a block-grant system, giving states greater control over how to spend it.\n\nWhatever happens, advocate Ann Oliva said this is a crucial time for tackling homelessness. A record number of people in the U.S. struggle to afford rent or mortgage. And she would expect that number to rise if the office in charge of homelessness prevention was effectively gutted.\n\n\"Possibly, construction would stop on affordable housing that's already in the pipeline,\" she said. \"Ultimately, I think the risk is that we will see people falling into homelessness even quicker than we've already seen over the last few years.\"\n\nWe tired, but we got to fight y'all.

    "selftext":"From: Paul Ward \n\nDate: July 30, 2025\n\nSubject: Proposal for Final Project: Addressing Homelessness and Mental Illness through Community-Based Solutions\n\n               Introductory Discussion\n\n     This memo outlines a proposal for my final project, which will address the very complex issue of homelessness and mental illness. Additionally, I will examine a hypothetical scenario where an executive order mandates the arrest and detention of homeless and mentally ill individuals in long term prisons, which would effectively be stripping them of their freedom due to them being poor and unhoused. My proposed solution, a comprehensive plan to establish therapeutic, self sufficient communities, offers a stark contrast to this Nazi dictator approach. This topic is a strong fit for the assignment as it demands a thorough analysis of a significant societal problem, the development of an innovative and multi faceted solution, and the persuasive articulation of its benefits and feasibility, all while engaging with various criteria areas of the course.\n\n     The situation I've identified, while presented as a hypothetical executive order, mirrors real world challenges and ethical dilemmas surrounding homelessness and mental illness. Across the United States, individuals experiencing homelessness often grapple with co-occurring mental health disorders, creating a vicious cycle that is difficult to break. The idea of incarcerating these poor, maybe mentally ill, addicted, and unhoused individuals, as posited in the executive order, is not only inhumane but also highly ineffective. Such an approach would exacerbate existing problems, strain an already overburdened justice system, and fail to address the root causes of homelessness and mental illness.\n\n    This project that I am proposing will offer solutions to a problem the government won't or can't figure out how to solve. It tackles the issue on how to humanely treat, and solve this issue with homelessness and mental health. The complexity of the problem and the ambitious nature of the proposed solution will allow me to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of policy development, logistical planning, and social impact assessment. \n\n     Research has shown the need for a compassionate approach while dealing with the unhoused population in society. For instance, a report by the National Alliance to End Homelessness (2023) highlights that chronic homelessness is often intertwined with serious mental illness and substance use disorders, emphasizing the need for integrated support services rather than punishment measures. This data provides helpful resources, and information to address, and fix this issue. For example, a study published in the Journal of Urban Health (Smith & Johnson, 2022) discusses the efficacy of \"Housing First\" models, which prioritize providing stable housing as a foundation for addressing other challenges like mental health. This research is very valuable and important as it offers evidence based alternatives to incarceration, demonstrating that community-based, supportive housing initiatives yield better outcomes for individuals and society. \n\n      Also, a publication from the American Psychological Association (APA) (Garcia, 2024) on the ethics of involuntary commitment for mental health patients reveals the delicate balance between individual liberty and public safety. While acknowledging extreme cases where intervention is necessary, the APA emphasizes the importance of least restrictive environments and patient autonomy.\n\nThe report will analyze the current landscape, present the detailed plan for therapeutic communities, and argue for its feasibility and benefits.\n\n    Finally I will address how to build 20 homeless cities with 15,000 tiny homes in each city to house the unhoused. A thousand homes for staff: medical personnel, social workers, police, firefighters, city workers, psychologists, and therapists. A city that will be self sustained by the homeless that will be staying there. To help run hospitals, stores, parks, utilities, and city jobs. I will also address how to get individuals on ss disability for ones who cannot work. I will also address how to civilly commit individuals who are to mentally unstable or refuse to get off the streets, and into these communities built for them.\n\nTo complete this project, I will undertake several distinct tasks:\n\nResearch \n\nI will start researching the laws and red tapes that will be affected by issuing executive orders. Such as, laws that might lead to the incarceration of a vulnerable population. This involves examining existing laws related to involuntary commitment, civil liberties, and the rights of unhoused individuals. I will also look into the historical context of similar policies, such as vagrancy and civil commitment laws, to understand their outcomes. \n\nDetailed solutions and planning to address the problems.\n\nsuch as sites to build, people to hire, and ways to get funding for the sites.\n\nArchitectural and urban planning.\n\nResearch how to build tiny houses, stores, city buildings, hospitals, waste management, and parks. \n\nFinancial Modeling and. FundingAllocation: I will develop a more detailed budget for the construction, operational costs, and ongoing maintenance of these cities. This will involve researching average costs for construction materials, labor, healthcare services, and social programs. I will justify the redirection of state and federal homelessness funding to these new initiatives, possibly exploring other potential funding streams (e.g., grants, public-private partnerships). This is crucial for demonstrating the financial feasibility of the plan. I will leverage economic reports and public policy analyses.\n\nStaffing and employment \n\nI will further research and apply the appropriate ratio of staff for medical personnel, social workers, city workers, and administration staff. To work in these homeless cities. And how to employ the individuals who are housed in these communities.\n\nI will also develop a more robust plan for the employment of formerly homeless individuals, including details on job training, skill development, and long-term career pathways. This part needs to be highly practical and address potential challenges in integrating residents into the workforce. I will look into workforce development programs and employment statistics.\n\nHealth care and hospitalization\n\nI will also address and fix how to legally, and safely get individuals into the homeless cities, and how to civilly commit those who refuse to go, and are to mentally unstable to make that decision themselves. This will include a panel of 5 doctors, 5 psychologists, and 5 therapists, 5 lawyers who will go over cases by case to either commit the individual for two years maximum, or recommend them to a group home that is more suited for the individual. After the two years release the individual back into the community with a case worker, psychologist, Doctor, and therapists who will work with them three times a week to see if they can fully transition back into society, or have to be civilly committed back to a mental health hospital or a group home for another two years. \n\nLogistics of Population Relocation and Integration: A detailed plan for identifying and relocating homeless individuals to these communities, ensuring it is done ethically and with respect for individual choice where possible. This also includes strategies for managing community dynamics and fostering a sense of belonging among residents. I will research best practices in community organizing and social integration.\n\nLegal compliance with the laws of the land.\n\nA detailed plan for identifying and relocating homeless individuals to these communities, ensuring it is done ethically and with respect for individual choice where possible. This also includes strategies for managing community dynamics and fostering a sense of belonging among residents. I will research best practices in community organizing and social integration.\n\nHuman rights \n\nmake sure these plans don't violate the civil liberties, and harm the mentally unstable, and houseless individuals that we are trying to help get off the streets. \n\nAddressing counterarguments and state red tapes \n\nI will address and fix any laws or red tape that will hinder any of these projects going forward by hiring lobbyists, a team of lawyers, doctors, psychologists, and therapists to help bypass these problems.\n\nWriting and revisions \n\nThe final stage involves synthesizing all research and analysis into a coherent, persuasive, and well-structured memo. This will include multiple drafts, focusing on clarity, conciseness, and persuasive language.\n\nHere is a proposed timeline for completing the project, aligning with our class schedule:\n\n Date \u2022 Task \u2022 months \u2022\n\nAugust 5, 2025 refine problem and solutions \n\nThe plan is structured to provide a detailed, month-by-month breakdown of the project, demonstrating a clear path from concept to full implementation.\n\nYear 1: Planning, Development, and Initial Construction\n\nMonths 1-3: Strategic Planning and Site Acquisition\n\n Task: Establish Project Management Office (PMO) and core leadership teams.\n\n Description: Recruit and hire project managers, lead architects, legal counsel, and community liaisons.\n\n Task: Conduct feasibility studies and secure land.\n\nDescription: Identify 20 potential sites across the country, prioritizing locations with access to existing infrastructure and job markets.

This will begin the two-year cycle of building new communities until all homeless people are off the streets.\n\n   So, in conclusion I have experience with the homeless, because I have been homeless off and on for the last 15 years or so. I have always had a plan on how to solve this homeless situation in the United States peacefully, and without violating people's rights. I have never understood how they cannot solve this problem. Well until recently, I finally understood that homelessness is a big money scheme for state and local governments. If they don't solve the homeless crisis then they can keep lining their pockets with tax payer dollars, and pretend that they are working on a solution.",

    "selftext":"UPDATE: Thanks everyone for the great questions! I have to run now but I'll keep checking this throughout the day\/evening and am more than happy to keep discussing if anything else comes up. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHi Reddit!\n\nI\u2019m a journalist (with a PhD in anthropology) who\u2019s spent the last several years reporting on America\u2019s worsening crisis of housing insecurity\u2014specifically, the growing number of families and individuals who are homeless despite having jobs (in many cases, more than one).\n\nMy new book,\u00a0*There Is No Place for Us: Working and Homeless in America*, comes out this week. It follows five families in Atlanta as they struggle to find stable housing while navigating low-wage work, predatory landlords, a lack of tenant protections, and a system that prioritizes profit over people's basic need for a home.\n\nThe book grew out of an article I wrote for\u00a0*The New Republic*\u00a0called [\u201cThe New American Homeless,\u201d](https:\/\/newrepublic.com\/article\/154618\/new-american-homeless-housing-insecurity-richest-cities) which went viral in 2019. Since then, I\u2019ve been trying to understand how the richest country in the world became a place where even a full-time job no longer guarantees a roof overhead\u2014and what it would take to change that. A couple of weeks ago,\u00a0*The New York Times*\u00a0published a [guest essay](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2025\/03\/01\/opinion\/crisis-working-homeless.html?unlocked_article_code=1.1U4.RMtS.Ermxh-P16gDJ) that distills some of my book\u2019s key arguments.\n\nAsk me anything!\n\n\\-\u00a0Why so many people with full-time jobs are becoming homeless  \n\\-\u00a0How U.S. homelessness is misunderstood and miscounted  \n\\-\u00a0Why extended-stay motels function as for-profit homeless shelters\u2014and how people get trapped in them  \n\\-\u00a0How a \u201cstrong\u201d economy can actually fuel homelessness and housing precarity\n\n\\- Why criminalizing homelessness is not only cruel but utterly counterproductive  \n\\-\u00a0The pernicious myth of the \"deserving poor\"  \n\\-\u00a0Atlanta\u2019s gentrification as a case study for what\u2019s happening across the country  \n\\-\u00a0What we could do\u2014right now\u2014to end this crisis  \n\\-\u00a0Or anything else about housing, poverty, or the systems that keep people unhoused\n\nProof:\u00a0\u00a0[https:\/\/imgur.com\/fbVrw4l](https:\/\/imgur.com\/fbVrw4l)  \nWebsite: [briangoldstone.net](http:\/\/briangoldstone.net)  \nBluesky: [https:\/\/bsky.app\/profile\/brian-goldstone.bsky.social](https:\/\/bsky.app\/profile\/brian-goldstone.bsky.social)  \nX:\u00a0[https:\/\/x.com\/brian\\_goldstone](https:\/\/x.com\/brian_goldstone)\u00a0",

I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.\n\nI\u2019m not looking for pity or a handout. I\u2019m just stuck and genuinely don\u2019t know what to do next. If anyone has advice, experience, or direction, I\u2019m open to anything realistic right now.\n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m at:\n\nIn the past month, I lost my full-time job, got into a car accident that totaled my vehicle, and got hit with an eviction notice. I\u2019m still in the apartment for now, but there\u2019s nothing here but two couches. Everything else is at my moms. Which I\u2019m not able to go too for multiple reasons. I\u2019ve been applying for jobs and trying to find a place to live, but without proof of income, I can\u2019t get approved for anything. And I can\u2019t fake paystubs or anything like that \u2014 the situation with my former employer is messy, and I\u2019m not trying to drag that drama out. It\u2019s complicated and not worth the risk.\n\nI don\u2019t have a support system to fall back on. I can\u2019t stay with my mom. Friends either don\u2019t have space or won\u2019t allow me to bring my cats.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the one thing I won\u2019t compromise on: I have three cats. They are everything to me. They\u2019ve been with me for years, and they\u2019ve been my only constant through all of this. I know it makes everything harder \u2014 trust me, I know. But I will not separate from them. I\u2019m not putting them in a shelter, and I\u2019m not handing them off. It\u2019s not up for debate. I\u2019ll sleep in my car before I give them up \n(I\u2019m in the process of getting a vehicle) \n\nAs for work \u2014 I\u2019m skilled. I\u2019ve got four \nyears of hands-on experience in plumbing and HVAC. I know electrical. I can install or repair home appliances. If it involves tools, I can probably figure it out. I\u2019ve also worked in retail. I\u2019ll take on anything \u2014 labor, service, side jobs, under-the-table work, whatever. I just need someone to give me a chance. I\u2019m willing and able. I want to work. I want to get back on my feet.\n\nBut right now I feel stuck in a loop:\nNo job \u2192 no apartment \u2192 no address \u2192 no job \u2192 and repeat.\n\nI\u2019m not looking to be saved. I\u2019m just asking:\n\t\u2022\tWhat would you do in this situation?\n\t\u2022\tAre there realistic ways to find pet-friendly housing without proof of income?\n\t\u2022\tAny leads on work where skills matter more than paperwork?\n\t\u2022\tOr any programs\/resources that don\u2019t separate you from your animals?\n\nThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. I just feel like I\u2019m running out of options and I\u2019m trying to keep from slipping into full panic mode.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been here \u2014 or somewhere close \u2014 and made it out, please tell me how.\n\nThanks to anyone who reads this.\n",

I do have a record of employment, but it\u2019s spotty; nothing over a year at any one place. Over the last few years it was doable\u2014 my parents could make ends meet with SSI\/SSDI and I would cook, clean, go to the grocery etc\u2014 but my mom passed right before the new year, and my dad passed last week. \n\n\nI wasn\u2019t aware until after my mom passed that she had fallen behind pretty severely on rent, and my landlord has been incredibly gracious, but the situation at hand is I have to move out by march 1 to avoid eviction proceedings and\/or an obligation for my mom\u2019s debt. I\u2019ve been looking around desperately since before my dad passed, and nobody has a couch for me; none of my friends, my grandparents, my godparents(who both live in different states). Essentially I can live out of my mom\u2019s car, hang out at the library during the day, sleep in Walmart parking lots at night, until the car is repossessed. That probably gives me an extra month. \n\nCremation costs for both my parents have totally kneecapped me, and I have just enough money left to afford an Amtrak ticket or a one-way flight, plus a few hundred to put myself up in a shared room for about a month. Southeast Louisiana is a really, REALLY bad place to be homeless, and the minimum wage is still 7.25 here. All the places I\u2019ve looked out-of-state want a minimum 250\/week, and I need proof of income 2x the weekly rate. Do I have ANY options? Is there some boat job in Alaska that I could fit into? Is there some Americorps-type volunteer gig that\u2019ll give me lodging? Is the couchsurfing app reliable? I don\u2019t qualify for military service so that isn\u2019t really an option right now, either. \n\n\nI\u2019m just kind of at my wit\u2019s end, and I\u2019m willing to keep my head down and move forward with my life, even if it\u2019s not a dream job in an awesome state, but I don\u2019t know where to go or how to go. If anybody has any suggestions, please, please let me know. I\u2019m trying not to feel totally adrift here, but I just can\u2019t make anything shake so far. ",

I\u2019m $5000 underwater on it. The Apr is 25% so it\u2019s taking me a while to pay it off. \n\nYes I\u2019m looking for higher paying jobs. I\u2019m earning $850 biweekly after taxes and deductions and this is considered a good job paying $16\/hour. Please don\u2019t mention the math because you are not seeing my deductions but my deductions are about $300 biweekly plus taxes are about $150. I cannot reduce my deductions because they are for healthcare. No I\u2019m not eligible for healthcare marketplace because my job offers health insurance. \n\nI found a part time job delivering pizzas.

I\u2019m not paying my therapists anymore even though they helped me get to this point of being able to work and helping me stay stable.

I\u2019m not dealing with my chronic joint pain because I can\u2019t afford physical therapy nor do I have anywhere to reliably go to do it. \n\nMy car payment is $320 a month. Yes it\u2019s high but to get to work I need a car and again, I\u2019m $5000 underwater. \n\nI could rent a room but those around my job are about $1000 or more because my job is downtown. I still can\u2019t get rid of the car but I wouldn\u2019t need to drive it to work if I\u2019m downtown. I\u2019d just need for appointments and errands. \n\nAgain I\u2019m only earning $850 biweekly and I\u2019ve tried getting referrals to jobs and applying directly to website and going to job fairs and I don\u2019t have a higher paying job yet. I\u2019m losing faith because I\u2019m putting in a lot of work and all I\u2019ve gotten out of it is pizza delivering. \n\nWhich option would you take in my situation? I don\u2019t have any close family or friends. Nobody at work is renting a room. I can\u2019t carpool because I don\u2019t live near any coworkers and we all have different schedules. \n\nI\u2019m living with my parents and my dad\u2019s evicting me because I don\u2019t follow his rules (personal items in the bathroom, if he puts something in the hallway I need to take it out of the hallway, if he tells me to open a window I need to open the window, etc. I was told I\u2019m not allowed to have different ideas in his house)\n\nYes I\u2019m an adult. I\u2019m 29. I have poor credit and lots of debt, $120k+ of debt and an eviction from a series of mental health hospitalizations. \n\nI have no one to co-sign anything for me. No guarantor.

Not even in the middle of nowhere Iowa or Nebraska or Wyoming. \n\nJust about everywhere I have looked in the US the cheapest rents are about $1000 a month even before utilities and even checking SpareRoom, Roommates, etc. Most people want a minimum of $1000 to be there roommate or rent a 200 square foot room. People have even given me the suggestion of renting a trailer somewhere. Same thing, every mobile home I have seen starts at around $1000 just for the rent before the lot fees + utilities. \n\nPeople tell me to stop looking at NYC or LA or Boston. But I am not. I'm looking at rural and suburban towns in the middle of nowhere. \n\nThen further more, the rare time a place pops up for $800 or so a month. The landlord wants a minimum income level of around $50K to $60K a year to even be considered. I just can't seem to win.\n\nAbout 4 years ago, I had a two bad employers that wouldn't pay me and I ended up in a ton of credit card debt. I've spent the last two years paying off all of the debt.

But even then it seems like even people are listing their single wides at $300K that need a lot of work and they are selling! As where true 800 square foot one story homes go for $400K in the middle of nowhere.\n\nI get the fact that people are trying to be helpful.

    "selftext":"This morning around 7 a.m., I was asleep in my car in a legal parking area in Florida. I have a clean, newer car with tinted windows and a windshield cover. I don\u2019t leave trash or make noise. I\u2019m a woman sleeping alone, trying to stay safe.\n\nA cop knocked on my window and looked at me with absolute disgust. He said, \u201cYou cannot be sleeping in your car,\u201d in a tone that made me feel like I was doing something dirty or criminal.\n\nAnd I just want to ask\u2014what do they expect me to do instead? Go sleep on the sidewalk? On the floor where there\u2019s garbage and animal feces? Would that be more acceptable? This is terrible.\n\nI\u2019m upset. Sleeping in your car isn\u2019t illegal in Florida if you\u2019re legally parked\u2014and I was. But beyond legality, what\u2019s broken is the way people in power treat you. I wasn\u2019t harming anyone. I was surviving. Quietly. Cleanly.\n\nI shower every day. I keep my car spotless. I have a job. I make sure no one can even tell I sleep in my car. And still, I get treated like trash. Like I\u2019m some kind of threat\u2014just for existing in a way that doesn\u2019t make people comfortable.\n\nThe system says shelters are the solution\u2014but we all know many of them are unsafe, overcrowded, or simply unavailable. For a woman, especially, sleeping in a locked car is far safer than sleeping in a shelter where you risk harassment or worse.\n\nSo I\u2019m asking honestly: What\u2019s the point of a law that criminalizes the safest option some people have? Why does survival have to come with so much shame?\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? How do you handle it?\n",

    "selftext":"Two steps forward, three steps back. I finally felt like I was making some progress and then I get knocked on my ass again. Finally have a stable budget and income, promotion at work should be enough to break even, biggest pain in the ass right now is CC debt. I made a lot of stupid decisions 18-22, including letting a long term girlfriend \"borrow\" somewhere in the ballpark of $5k from me (I know, I know. it's a hard lesson I'll be carrying probably for the rest of my life) as well as a roughly 9 month span of homeless\/housing insecurity when I was 19, so now I'm trudging through paying off a ~$11,800 credit card balance. I've been trying to put $300 towards it every month (minimum payment is around $240) which I've largely been earning through donating my plasma. \n\nAfter the new donor bonus ran up, I was getting about $100\/week. So $300 towards the credit card and $100 to save, not terrible, but something. I took out student loans and got a degree double majoring in two things that pay like shit without a graduate degree (psych and envsci) because I wanted to study things I was passionate about, now I make $17\/hr working full time as a park ranger. I'm in need-based deferment on my loans right now. My primary goal while I'm not making payments is to figure out a way to make more money. I'm no longer accumulating any additional cc debt aside from interest thankfully, I'm on food stamps and Medicaid. \n\nSo everything was going ok, I was saving a tiny bit each month, I was making little dents in the credit card balance (my credit score is 712 somefuckinghow, maybe because I've never missed a payment, last year before I had to pay for a $2k medical bill with it my score was inching towards 750), and then a fucking bat got into my house. I have no idea how long the little bastard was in here for, but we caught it and had animal control collect it for testing. Guess what...rabies positive. Health department ordered we all get post exposure shots. I had donated plasma the day before, so I called the office just in case I had just sent over rabies-infected blood. I was informed after completing the PEP I will not be able to donate for the next 12 months to ensure I do not have the rabies virus in my system. Totally fair. But...that missing $400 is going to fucking suck. I'm so mad. \n\nI'm 23, I'm renting a place with 3 roommates, I have a car with a loan I'm on track to pay off in 4 years but with high enough mileage that I really don't want to get back into doordash. I know I got myself into this situation and made a lot of stupid choices. I'm just trying to figure out the best way forward. The promotion I just got might be enough to cover the difference, but it's tight. I wish I had picked a different major, or that I never met my ex and gave her all of that money, or that I never needed to have that surgery that ate up so much of my savings, or that I hadn't been kicked out of the house as a teenager. Coulda-shoulda-woulda, I don't want people to call me a dumbass because I already know. I don't want to get a job doing something I don't really care about because I do genuinely want to keep working in the outdoors, just something that will pay me better. I wish I'd had less shit going on in school so I could've talked and thought about this more, but I was so focused on just trying to survive and not drop out that I didn't think about what happens next. I just don't want this degree of stress and suffering to be my life forever. ",

[Home is of, relating to, or being a place of residence, place of origin, or base of operations] so that does not mean a physical house. It can be a physical house, but essentially, it is where you live, whether you choose to or not. Some people choose to live in their car.... that makes it their home. If you choose to live in a shed, that is your home.... tent\/box, etc. Wherever you reside is your home. In theory, no one is ever really homeless; they are just houseless. Yeah, I might be getting technical, but I think it's important to understand the difference because sometimes those little details matter. Telling yourself that you're homeless when you don't have a physical house can take a toll on mental health. If you understand that you always have a home but are temporarily houseless, it doesn't hit as hard. This is all in my own opinion, anyways. I have been houseless many times, and I've even been forced onto the streets but have also chosen a few times to live that lifestyle to save money or relieve the stress of bills and rent.",

    "selftext":"EDIT: 1997 Toyota Camry\n\nMe, my bf and 2 cats are stranded right over the causeway in tampa, and my strongest belief is the water pump as it sounds like a gurgling\/rattle that progressively got worse. At this point, it's just pouring water out of the weep hole as I fill the radiator.\n\nI'm close to taking the timing belt off, and I noticed that the sprockets and the markers aren't aligned up and I don't don't want to do now, I'm still researching and it's taking too long and if I have to rush it I'm worried about messing up since I don't understand why its not aligned. We've been here 2 days now and it was very cold last night. We will owe it to anyone who can help with steps or coming out to help. I can do $100 if you give me like 2 weeks maybe even less, I'm a very honest person and don't try to screw people over for no reason as it has happened to me too many times and i felt unbelievable hurt. Or whatever you think is reasonable. I already have most of it off, and my hands are small, so it's easier to work in the small space.\n\nI don't think I have the right stuff to unscrew the crank pully and we are working with $30 which were really trying not to spend on anything yet because we need gas to work and we shouldn't even be in tampa right now because we missed our exit in St Petersburg to stop at an auto store there before the car started to overheat again. Now, it won't drive at all without overheating in like 4 minutes.\n\nUPDATE: Someone helped me realize that it wasn't aligned because I didn't go through enough rotations. Now I'm somewhere too far from a walmart to make it before they close to get a breaker bar to bump the crank and get the bolt off. If anyone has one and come help with just this, I should be good. Honestly, this spot might be good for a night of sleep, too, as we were parked here overnight fixing this. Noisy road, but no tow away signs or anything!\n\nUPDATE 2: I tried to use my medium sized ratchet with the 19mm socket on a pole extender to do the starter bump method on their harmonizer. The ratchet lock popped inside the ratchet, so now the sockets don't fit and that's a first for me. No more leads on what to do now and we're feeling extremely miserable at this point. What can I do with $30 idkk\n\nUPDATE 3: 4:35am I had couple more ideas I could try to support the harmonizor to take it off, but failed and gave up and had to sleep.\n10:00am. We were freezing all morning, we're going crazy, a series of unfortunate events that keeps happening to us and had done all we can given our circumstances..\n\nUPDATE 4: We're still stranded here and things are about to get way worse for us.",

I found solice in cooking and cleaning and moving around what felt like a private living space freely. Being in the car my head is constantly on a swivel, to stand up and stretch I have to get out and the only hint of privacy is in a bathroom or the changing rooms in my gym, I feel like I'm constantly being surveilled no matter where I park, I feel like any person or car is a threat, and I'm falling apart at the seams. An option people kept trying to throw at me was going back to the original state I moved from and living in my abusive\/rodent infested family home, but I kept pushing it away, expressing heavily that I am in a rocky mental state due to that home and those parents that say they love me and express it so toxicly. I guess what I'm trying to ask is if that father in that home is still naming me on his insurance and using it I made an appointment with the psychiatrist on talkspace and was prescribed the medication again but only in the state they live in, what should I do? Because I think I could get a job soon, but the options for jobs right now are currently limited, and some don't offer any insurance and the ones that might have a wait time before it kicks in and even so the insurance may not cover what my father's covers and I'm scared that the only way to get the meds to get a better psyche while living in this car would be to live back there in the place that is the reason I'm talking the meds to begin with. I'm honestly so claustrophobic in my own mind that what I'm really asking for is someone, anyone, to help me see at least one thing I could do that I'm not currently seeing myself. A path I could take that I'm too overwhelmed to see.\n\nPs: my so does not live in the car with me, she was not displaced from the original housing we were offered when coming to the state, only I was due to what turned into a very toxic and abusive environment towards me(the outsider\/non-family member) ",

    "selftext":"Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m honestly not the type to put my personal life out on the internet, but I\u2019m at a point where I don\u2019t know where else to turn. My wife and I are in nearly $200,000 of debt and we\u2019re drowning. I\u2019ve read some posts on here that gave me a bit of hope, so I figured maybe if I shared our story, someone might have some advice or point us in a direction we haven\u2019t thought of.\n\nOur situation:\n\nWe\u2019re both in our early 30s. No kids yet. We\u2019ve been together since college, always tried to be responsible, and thought we were making smart choices. But over the last several years, things have piled up. Now it\u2019s just become this massive mountain we can\u2019t seem to get in front of.\n\nHere\u2019s what our debt looks like:\n\t\u2022\tCredit cards: about $38,000 across four cards, most of them with really high interest rates\n\t\u2022\tPersonal loans: $26,000, mostly taken to consolidate old debt, which clearly didn\u2019t work\n\t\u2022\tAuto loans: $31,000 combined for two cars, one is still upside-down\n\t\u2022\tStudent loans: $70,000 total between the two of us\n\t\u2022\tMedical bills and miscellaneous stuff: $5,000\n\t\u2022\tIRS debt: $6,000 from back taxes during the pandemic when we were both underemployed\n\nWe\u2019re currently making about $110,000 a year combined. We rent, live in a medium cost of living area, and try to cut every expense we can. We don\u2019t eat out, we canceled all subscriptions except the bare minimum, and we\u2019ve already sold a bunch of stuff. But we\u2019re still falling behind.\n\nHow it got this bad:\n\nIt wasn\u2019t one big decision, it was a slow buildup. My wife lost her job during COVID. I had my hours cut. We lived off credit cards for a while, thinking things would turn around soon. Then her mom got sick and passed, and we helped out financially with some of the medical and funeral costs. I know people say not to go into debt for family, but when it\u2019s someone you love, it doesn\u2019t feel like a choice at the time.\n\nWe took out personal loans to try to clean up the credit card mess, but then we fell behind on those too. One step forward, two steps back. Now we\u2019re paying hundreds in minimum payments every month and the balances barely move because the interest is so high.\n\nWe\u2019ve looked into options, but everything feels confusing or risky. I don\u2019t want to get scammed or make things worse.\n\nWhat we\u2019re asking:\n\nIf anyone has been in a similar place, how did you get out? What actually works? We\u2019re open to anything at this point.\n\nWe\u2019ve looked into:\n\n\u2022 Credit counseling\n\u2022 Debt management programs\n\u2022 Debt settlement\n\u2022 Bankruptcy (which honestly scares the hell out of us)\n\u2022 Refinancing our auto loans\n\u2022 Trying the snowball or avalanche method, which we\u2019re currently doing, but progress is slow\n\nWe\u2019d love to hear real experiences. The good, the bad, anything. If you used a legit service or nonprofit organization that helped, please let us know. If you filed for bankruptcy and it worked out, or didn\u2019t, I\u2019d like to hear that too.\n\nEven if you just have some encouragement or a reality check, I\u2019m open to it. I\u2019m trying to be honest with myself and with the situation. We\u2019re not lazy. We\u2019re not irresponsible. But we are in over our heads and just trying to survive right now.\n\nThanks for reading this and taking the time. I know it\u2019s a mess. But I appreciate any help or advice you\u2019re willing to share.",

    "selftext":"PLEASE USE LOCAL FOOD BANKS. \n\nYou can use food banks even if you already have food at home. You can use food banks even if you have money to buy food. You can use food banks even if you are only temporarily struggling financially. You can use food banks even if you aren't on the verge of starvation. You can use food banks even if you have a car. You can use food banks even if you have nice things. You can use food banks even if you are employed. You can use food banks even if you are unemployed. You can use food banks even if you are eligible or already receieving government aid.\n\nThe use of food banks is heavily stigmatized and misunderstood. Not wanting to use one out of the belief that you don't truly need it, so that the people who do can have access to the resources they need, is perfectly understandable and admirable. But understanding when you need it is the part that some struggle with as it is often stigmatized as a personal failure or only for people who are in extreme poverty. Food banks are there to help anyone, and they receive funding based on the number of people who use the service. So by not utilizing this resource, you are only setting yourself back as well as not allowing the food bank to give an accurate figure to report to receive funding. \n\nFood banks help fill the nutritional gaps in you diet, as well as providing food that you may not have access to, meaning it is okay to use them even if you already have food at home. Just because you have rice and potatoes at home, does not mean you can't go to pick up a protein source and some vegetables\/fruits to supplement your diet. \n\nFood banks are there to help you free up money in your budget, so that you don't have to pick and choose which bills to pay or fall behind on something just to eat. You do not need to neglect getting maintenance work done on your car or getting your healthcare needs met, so that you can afford food. It is okay to go even if you technically have money in your account to buy food, but that money could help you out significanlty if it went elsewhere.\n\nFood banks are the perfect option for those who are only temporarily struggling as they require less commitment than applying for social services. They are there to help bridge the gap needed during financial hardships due to any cause. You do not need a good enough reason in order to go. \n\nFood banks are there so that people do not go hungry, as no one should know what that feels like. Even if you aren't on the verge of starvation or extreme nutritional deficits, you should still go as you deserve a warm, satisfying meal to look forward to each day. \n\nFood banks are great for those who don't have access to transportation or nearby grocery stores, but that doesn't mean you can't use one if you have a car. Sometimes, access to a car is all you have and it will only help you bring your food home easier. You do not need to sell your car or any of your possessions first, before you consider going to a food bank. People can go through extreme financial changes in only a short period of time, and the food bank is there to help. If you really want, you can offer to give someone a ride home at the food bank who had to walk there. \n\nNo matter whether you are employed or unemployed, the food bank is there so that you do not have to go without food as no one deserves to suffer in that way. Whether you need the energy for work, or applying to jobs and attending interviews, your body and your health matters and the food bank is there to help you meet your needs. \n\nGovernment aid does not always meet everyone's needs, especially with the ongoing changes happening and restrictions on what you are allowed to buy. So even if you are already receiving help, it is okay to go to the food bank to cover the gaps. That is exactly what it is intended to do.\n\nIf you are still uncomfortable with the idea of utilizing a food bank, you can always pay it forward.

    "selftext":"I posted on here before and got great advice. I've been trying everything. I talked to a recruiter for about a month, but I don't know what to do anymore. I passed PT assessments. I did the MEPS process and signed the contract. I was supposed to be leaving out for basic training on the 26th. I didn't know anything about the mental health guidelines for the military, and I guess they did the background and found out I admitted and stayed in a mental hospital for 10 days. I did, of course. But I did it at a time I most wanted to kill myself.\n\nI'm not eating every day and losing weight. My mom passed away, and I got left alone with the house and lost it. I was working but quit when I got further along in the recruitment process. I thought it was a sure thing.  But I did all of that just for them to ring this up at the last second. And they told me I can't leave out now. I'm trying to escape homelessness, starvation, and depression. This was my only way out, and I'm devastated because I made friends and people who cared that I was supposed to join with. Now I'm stuck back here. With a car that needs an altenator. I can't even move it, and it's the only thing I have. I use it to sleep in. I dropped my classes also, and I truly have nothing going for me. I'm 19 and got hit with this life shit pretty early. I miss my mom so much.\n\nPart of me just wants to be with her at this point. I didn't come to cry, but what would or do you do at this point? I tried but feel like the world is rejecting me. I'm in this car that I can't move, I don't have any friends or family to fall back on right now. Idec about eating anymore. My plan for elevating my life went to shit. I'm feeling depression sink back in. And I never wanted it to come back. I've been crying all day. I feel so alone. ",

Dad's were not around. Yes I grew up in a trailer park.\n\nI started working retail at 16. I worked my way up to shift Manger then assistant. I always volunteered to work extra and go the extra mile. By the time I was 25, I was a store manager for smallish sized clothing company with about 200 stores. At the time making $45k. Which was really good money. The year was about 2010 for reference. My mother passed away a year later and I had nothing tying me down here. I was renting a room in an apartment. \n\nI was later recruited to large retsiler and given a solid offer $75k that also provided a relocation. I was put in a shit store but worked the location and met our metrics. I also moved two states away and a different time zone. This was about 2019.\n\nI was recruited again to a competitor so to speak and now work in the HR\/Benefits world. I did start at a lower position but they matched my pay. I have now worked up to a specific position that requires certifications. I make $125k plus bonus. My employer paid for certificates.\n\nThat's how I escaped. It wasn't glorious. I worked a ton of nights weekends and holidays. I missed functions, events, and so forth. \n\nBut I'm 38 now. \nMarried, own my home, we have an awesome son and a 401k that is well funded. My son will never have to endure my struggles but he is being taught the value of a dollar. I work fully remote, m-f. Hours vary, as my function is more task driven. My wife is a stay at home mother.\n\nSo the answer is retail, sacrifice 20 years of a life and move around. Not the best answer but it worked for me. And I only have a high school diploma. I also believe I will end my generational poverty.",

I couldn\u2019t afford the dental work I needed, so after reading a few posts on Reddit, I decided to try getting dental care in Los Algodones, Mexico. It\u2019s a small town right across the border from Yuma, Arizona. Algodones is often referred to as \u201cThe Molar Capital of the World\u201d due to the high number of dental clinics concentrated in the town.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve had a sinus lift, two implants, deep cleanings, regular cleanings,root canals, crowns, extractions, fillings, and Zoom whitening. The quality of care has been great. My sister\u2019s come with me and has had an implant, bone graft, root canals, wisdom teeth removal, crowns, and fillings. \n\nWe\u2019ve saved thousands getting our dental work done in Mexico. The dentists we\u2019ve seen have been professional, kind, and didn\u2019t try to upsell anything. The clinics are clean and modern. If you stay in Yuma, some clinics even offer free shuttles to and from the border, which makes the trip really easy.\n\nIt\u2019s not for everyone. You\u2019ll need a passport, and you\u2019ll have to do your homework but if dental care feels out of reach financially, this could be a legit option.\n\n\n",
